# CLI

`bin/shipguard` is a dependency-light helper for validating and reusing this workflow kit. Inside the ShipGuard source checkout, examples use `./bin/shipguard`. Inside an app checkout, install the CLI once with `PREFIX="$HOME/.local" ./scripts/install.sh` from the ShipGuard source or release package, then run `shipguard` or `$HOME/.local/bin/shipguard`.

## Validate

Run this from a checkout of this repository:

```bash
./bin/shipguard validate
```

You can also pass a path to another checkout of this workflow bundle:

```bash
./bin/shipguard validate ../shipguard
```

Validation checks required files, skill metadata, shell syntax, executable scripts, local markdown links, YAML files, and whitespace.

## Policy

Create or inspect a policy file:

```bash
./bin/shipguard policy init .shipguard/policy.conf
./bin/shipguard policy show .shipguard/policy.conf
```

Pass a policy into Autopsy with `--policy`. See `policy.md`.

## Version

Print the toolkit version:

```bash
./bin/shipguard version
```

The command reads `VERSION`, which is also used by the release packaging script.

## Init

Copy a starter workflow profile into another project:

```bash
./bin/shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard init web ../my-web-app
./bin/shipguard init backend ../my-service
./bin/shipguard init cli ../my-tool
```

The command writes:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `PLANS.md` from `templates/common/PLANS.md`
- `SUBAGENTS.md` from `templates/common/SUBAGENTS.md`
- `SCORECARD.md`
- `.agents/skills/`

Existing files are skipped. Use `--force` to overwrite generated workflow files:

```bash
./bin/shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app --force
./bin/shipguard init web ../my-web-app --force
./bin/shipguard init backend ../my-service --force
./bin/shipguard init cli ../my-tool --force
```

See `template-profiles.md` for profile details.

## Doctor

Check whether a target repo has the starter workflow files:

```bash
./bin/shipguard doctor ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard doctor ios ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard doctor web ../my-web-app
./bin/shipguard doctor backend ../my-service
./bin/shipguard doctor cli ../my-tool
```

`doctor` without a profile defaults to `ios` for compatibility with older releases.

## Task Contract

Use `prepare` before Codex edits and `verify` after Codex edits when a task needs scoped proof instead of a loose report directory:

```bash
./bin/shipguard prepare \
  "Add provisional notification onboarding flow" \
  --path ../my-ios-app \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-task \
  --profile ios \
  --validation "xcodebuild test -scheme MyApp -only-testing:NotificationPermissionTests" \
  --shareable

./bin/shipguard verify \
  --task /tmp/shipguard-task/shipguard-task.json \
  --diff /tmp/change.diff \
  --evidence /tmp/xcodebuild-receipt.json \
  --claim "Implemented the onboarding permission flow." \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-verdict
```

`prepare` writes `shipguard-task.json` and `shipguard-task.md` with repo context, risk, allowed files, protected boundaries, required validation, tracked claims, and the next exact action. `verify` writes `shipguard-verdict.json` and `shipguard-verdict.md` with changed files, scope violations, structured validation coverage, rejected overclaims, diff-first merge status, and the next exact action.

See `task-contract.md`.

## Profile Audits

After a starter profile is installed, run the profile-native first audit for non-iOS targets:

```bash
./bin/shipguard web audit --path ../my-web-app --out /tmp/shipguard-web-audit --shareable
./bin/shipguard backend audit --path ../my-service --out /tmp/shipguard-backend-audit --shareable
./bin/shipguard cli audit --path ../my-tool --out /tmp/shipguard-cli-audit --shareable
./bin/shipguard web plan --report /tmp/shipguard-web-audit --target ../my-web-app --out /tmp/shipguard-web-plan --shareable
./bin/shipguard backend plan --report /tmp/shipguard-backend-audit --target ../my-service --out /tmp/shipguard-backend-plan --shareable
./bin/shipguard cli plan --report /tmp/shipguard-cli-audit --target ../my-tool --out /tmp/shipguard-cli-plan --shareable
```

- `shipguard web audit` writes ShipGuard WebScan reports with framework, auth/payment, validation, starter-health, scan-transparency, and next-command evidence. Generated ShipGuard starter files count toward starter health, not target framework, validation, or risk signals.
- `shipguard web plan` writes ShipGuard WebForge reports that convert WebScan findings into scoped tasks, validation commands, stop conditions, and report-quality questions.
- `shipguard backend audit` writes ShipGuard ServiceRadar reports with API, auth, migration, queue, webhook, observability, validation, scan-transparency, and next-command evidence. Generated ShipGuard starter files count toward starter health, not target framework, validation, or risk signals.
- `shipguard backend plan` writes ShipGuard ServiceForge reports that convert ServiceRadar findings into scoped backend tasks, validation commands, stop conditions, and report-quality questions.
- `shipguard cli audit` writes ShipGuard CommandLens reports with dispatch, argument parsing, stdout/stderr, exit-code, redaction, packaging, scan-transparency, and next-command evidence. Generated ShipGuard starter files count toward starter health, not target framework, validation, or risk signals.
- `shipguard cli plan` writes ShipGuard CommandForge reports that convert CommandLens findings into CLI contract tasks, smoke checks, validation commands, stop conditions, and report-quality questions.

Add `--shipguard-eval` when using a target repo only as ShipGuard product QA, and use `shipguard ios report-quality --reports <audit-or-plan-dir> --out <quality-dir> --shareable` to grade whether the report itself is actionable. Profile plan commands are still read-only; they do not authorize target-app edits.

## iOS ShipGuard

Run iOS-specific topology, inventory, planning, proof, preview, and privacy helpers before risky Codex edits:

```bash
./bin/shipguard ios doctor --path ../my-ios-app --out /tmp/ios-shipguard-doctor
./bin/shipguard ios inventory --path ../my-ios-app --out /tmp/ios-shipguard-inventory
./bin/shipguard ios plan --mode permission-audit --inventory /tmp/ios-shipguard-inventory/ios-inventory.json --out /tmp/ios-shipguard-plan

```

`ios doctor` writes `ios-doctor.json` and `ios-doctor.md` with a privacy-safe `<target-repo>` root, stable `schemaVersion`/`generatedAt` metadata, target topology, and structured findings. That makes DockCheck usable as first evidence for `ios inventory`, `ios report-quality`, and release/package proof without exposing local checkout paths.

The iOS namespace also includes:

- `brand` or `ios brand`: run ShipGuard Brand Deck, the toolkit-wide naming contract for future surfaces. It audits the branded surface scheme, public-command coverage, active docs coverage, stale active wording, and the rule that fun names must sit beside plain purpose and proof boundaries.
- `prepare` and `verify`: run the core ShipGuard Task Contract loop. `prepare` creates one durable task object before Codex edits; `verify` checks the exact diff, evidence receipts, and agent claims against that object and returns pass, review, or blocked with one exact next action.
- `value-gauntlet`: run ShipGuard Tool Value Gauntlet, a read-only ShipYard product-QA report that grades every command, skill, plugin, GitHub Action, doc, test, package proof, and proof boundary for real developer usefulness before new surfaces are treated as mature. Its Lowest-Value Surface Probe ranks deeper evidence signals, executes representative ShipGuard commands on public/demo inputs through `runtimeOutputProbe`, rejects decorative or boundaryless reports through `runtimeOutputNegativeFixtures`, executes `--help` for all public commands through `runtimeCommandFamilyCoverage`, executes skill/plugin workflow receipts through `skillPluginRuntimeReceipts`, proves report-quality-to-spec-to-next-goal handoffs through `workflowChainReceipts`, runs complete public maintainer-loop proof through `scenarioMatrixReceipts`, proves bad evidence is blocked through `scenarioFailureReceipts`, proves repair and successful rerun paths through `scenarioRemediationReceipts`, proves fresh package install/plugin/audit handoff through `adoptionReceipts`, proves fresh iOS target starter onboarding through `targetOnboardingReceipts`, proves iOS/web/backend/CLI starter onboarding through `multiProfileOnboardingReceipts`, proves web/backend/CLI first-audit reports through `profileNativeFirstAuditReceipts`, proves web/backend/CLI fix plans through `profileNativeFixPlanReceipts`, proves web/backend/CLI validation classification through `profileNativeValidationReceipts`, proves blocked web/backend/CLI validation lanes clear after fixture-local smallest repairs through `profileNativeValidationRerunReceipts`, proves repaired web/backend/CLI plans emit copy-ready evidence packets through `profileNativeProofHandoffReceipts`, proves major command-family JSON/Markdown runtime output through `commandFamilyRuntimeOutputReceipts`, proves trust-hardening through `trustHardeningReceipts`, and proves diff-first prepare/verify behavior through `taskContractReceipts`. Once those pass, it escalates to the iOS notification and permission workflow instead of declaring the ShipYard finished.
- `web audit`, `backend audit`, and `cli audit`: run ShipGuard WebScan, ServiceRadar, and CommandLens for non-iOS repos. These are read-only first audits that turn starter-profile installation into concrete target source/config/test signals, validation guidance, next commands, and report-quality questions instead of stopping at `init` and `doctor`. The reports list generated ShipGuard starter files separately and do not count them as target proof.
- `web plan`, `backend plan`, and `cli plan`: run ShipGuard WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge for non-iOS audit reports. These are read-only fix-plan receipts that turn first-audit output into scoped tasks, validation commands, validation receipts, validation rerun receipts, stop conditions, and report-quality questions without authorizing target-app edits. Add `--target <repo>` to classify each validation lane as runnable, blocked, manual, or not checked without executing arbitrary target commands; blocked or unchecked lanes also get the smallest repair guidance and a shareable rerun command.
- `ios preview`: serve a local simulator screenshot preview for the Codex in-app browser.
- `ios devspace`: expose the preview bridge as a local MCP/App surface.
- `ios devspace-check`: statically grade ShipGuard Devspace connector readiness, public URL safety, widget metadata, handoff boundaries, and preview evidence without starting the server or grading a target app; add `--shareable` to omit local absolute paths before external sharing.
- `ios target-match`: rank visual preview events against XcodeBuildMCP UI snapshots.
- `ios codex-handoff`: prepare a guarded Codex app-server handoff.
- `ios plan --mode performance-audit`: route FPS, hitches, launch/scroll stutter, profiler fallback, and device-vs-simulator proof gaps.
- `ios launchdeck`: make ShipGuard the front door for the LaunchDeck surface. It inspects project/workspace/package/scheme topology, selects the right launch workflow, and emits XcodeBuildMCP build/run, simulator browser, SwiftUI preview hot reload, debugger, and performance-profiler handoff steps plus proof boundaries. Add `--receipt <file-or-dir>` after Codex executes the LaunchDeck route to grade whether build/run, UI, preview, log, or profiler proof is actually present. LaunchDeck owns routing and receipt grading; Codex iOS execution tools perform the simulator, preview, debugger, and profiler work.
- `ios performance`: run ShipGuard PulseRadar, scanning Swift source for ranked app-side performance hotspots before Codex edits; reports carry a `runtimeEvidenceBoundary` that labels source-only evidence as `source heuristic`, `confidence: medium`, `runtimeProof: missing`, and `blocking: no`, plus an `evidencePromotion` contract that names the first promotable source suspicion and one exact next action with owner, manual proof or command, expected artifact, success condition, and failure meaning. Findings include impact/why-it-matters explanations, high-severity reasons, local/manual proof boundaries, and grouped next actions for repeated rule clusters in JSON and Markdown. Add `--shareable` when performance reports will move into ChatGPT, GitHub, docs, benchmark fixtures, release evidence, or report-quality scoring.
- `ios design`: run ShipGuard VibeCheck, auditing app-type-specific UI/UX coherence, motion, haptics, preview routing, and ImageGen app-icon handoff before visual work; it emits native `motionQualityGates` for frequency, purpose, keyboard, Reduce Motion, AI-slop, and performance checks, a `designTailoring` contract that ties app type, source signals, guidance profile, tailored motion/haptics/visual-density/copy dimensions, and one exact next proof action together, plus `designCoherenceBoundary` so source inventory, coherence risks, ShipGuard next actions, app-work authorization, and proof boundaries do not collapse into target-app remediation. Add `--shareable` when design reports will move into ChatGPT, GitHub, docs, benchmark fixtures, release evidence, or report-quality scoring.
- iOS source scanners skip generated/proof/cache directories such as build output, release artifacts, scratch folders, web assets, and plugin/editor caches; reports include a scan-scope summary so private-app product QA stays auditable.
- `--shipguard-eval`: mark `ios launchdeck`, `ios performance`, `ios design`, `ios modernize`, `ios app-intelligence`, or `ios ai-readiness` as ShipGuard product QA only, so findings improve ShipGuard rather than becoming target-app work; add `--shareable` before those reports move into report-quality scoring or external planning.
- `ios report-quality`: grade ShipGuard report usefulness across read-only product-QA outputs; it evaluates report structure, boundaries, proof guidance, scan scope, performance runtime-evidence boundaries, performance evidence-promotion next actions, design app-type tailoring contracts, design coherence boundaries, performance finding impact explanations, high-severity reasons, local/manual proof boundaries, repeated performance grouping, grouped first experiments, declared shareability, token/path shareability, redaction handoff, aggregated actionability questions, fixture candidates, promotion manifests, existing fixture coverage, and a prioritized next action, not target-app quality. Add `--shareable` when the report-quality artifact itself will move into ChatGPT, GitHub, docs, benchmark fixtures, or release evidence. Add `--write-fixture-candidates <dir>` to materialize generated fixture candidates as synthetic public starter files plus `fixture-promotion-manifest.json` and `PROMOTION.md`; already-materialized synthetic fixtures and questions covered by promoted public fixtures keep their evidence but do not generate recursive or duplicate fixture candidates, and materialized-root scoring consumes promotion manifests as metadata instead of grading them as reports.
- `ios modernize`: run ShipGuard UpgradeForge for Swift, SwiftUI, Observation, accessibility, localization, and availability risks; add `--shareable` before report-quality scoring or external sharing.
- `ios app-intelligence`: run ShipGuard SignalLens for App Intents, shortcuts, widgets, Spotlight, controls, and system exposure; add `--shareable` before report-quality scoring or external sharing.
- `ios ai-readiness`: run ShipGuard ModelDock to compare on-device, cloud, Core ML, and no-AI options before model work; add `--shareable` before report-quality scoring or external sharing.
- `ios external-audit`: run ShipGuard SourceScout to inspect external workflow checkouts or URLs as ShipGuard product inputs and emit a native replacement ledger with source inputs, capability matrix, implementation backlog, license boundary, and report-quality questions. Use this before saying Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Design Motion Principles, X posts, or another repo has been "integrated"; adoption only counts when a capability has a ShipGuard-native action and validation command. Add `--shareable` before report-quality scoring or external sharing.
- `ios spec-workflow`: run ShipGuard SpecForge to convert a feature idea or report-quality actionability questions into ShipGuard-owned constitution, spec, requirements checklist, native integration decisions, plan, tasks, consistency analysis, analysis gates, slash plan/goal, and Devspace guardrails; add `--from-report <report-quality-dir>` to ground adoption work in observed ShipGuard output, and add `--shareable` before report-quality scoring or external planning. Repeated report-quality questions are deduplicated before the clarifying-question and task caps. Report-quality verifies the declared spec-workflow files exist, are non-empty, preserve report-quality questions in clarifying questions, acceptance criteria, proof-gated tasks, checklist coverage, integration decisions, consistency analysis, exact validation commands, analysis gates, and copy-ready `/plan` plus `/goal` next-loop handoff text, and include expected headings, proof cues, replacement/evaluation decisions, and guardrails before the bundle passes.
- `ios redact`: run ShipGuard RedactionBay to redact local iOS reports before sharing.
- `ios eval`: run ShipGuard EvalArena deterministic behavior evals.
- `ios demo`: run the clean first-run iOS ShipGuard loop without Xcode, Simulator, credentials, or an API key.
- `ios goals`: run ShipGuard GoalEngine to emit and complete evidence-gated ShipGuard slash-goals; use `ios goals init --completed-through <goal-id> --completion-evidence <proof>` to bootstrap a loop from already-proven shipped work without replaying stale goals one by one.

See `ios-shipguard.md`, `ios-preview.md`, `shipguard-devspace.md`, and `shipguard-naming.md`.

## Score

Score a Codex run markdown file:

```bash
./bin/shipguard score examples/scored-run.md
```

The score file must include these categories:

- Scope control
- Owner-file accuracy
- Risk awareness
- Validation quality
- Handoff honesty
- Regression awareness

Each category should include a value from `0` to `2`.

## Autopsy

Generate Markdown and JSON evidence reports for an AI coding run:

```bash
./bin/shipguard autopsy \
  --run fixtures/autopsy/good-run/run.md \
  --task fixtures/autopsy/good-run/task.md \
  --diff fixtures/autopsy/good-run/diff.patch \
  --tests fixtures/autopsy/good-run/tests.log \
  --out /tmp/autopsy-good
```

The command writes:

- `report.md`
- `report.json`

It checks the run score, validation claims, test evidence, diff size, high-assurance claims, and protected-area touches. High-severity findings produce a `do not merge until high-risk findings are resolved` verdict.

See `autopsy.md` for the full guide.

## Arena

Run a fixture pack through Autopsy and aggregate the results:

```bash
./bin/shipguard arena run \
  --fixture fixtures/arena \
  --out /tmp/arena
```

The command writes aggregate `results.json`, a readable `index.md`, and per-case autopsy reports under `runs/<case-id>/`.

See `arena.md` for the fixture format and metrics.

Import an external fixture pack before running it:

```bash
./bin/shipguard arena import \
  --source external-pack \
  --out /tmp/imported-arena-pack \
  --pack-name "external-pack"
```

The import command copies only supported fixture files, writes `PACK.md` with the source basename, rejects overlapping source/output directories, and blocks unsupported files, nested directories, symlinks, obvious local paths, or secret-looking values.

Sign and verify fixture-pack metadata:

```bash
./bin/shipguard arena sign \
  --fixture /tmp/imported-arena-pack \
  --out /tmp/imported-arena-pack/PACK.json \
  --pack-name "external-pack" \
  --signer "Example Maintainers" \
  --signer-url "https://github.com/example/repo"

./bin/shipguard arena verify \
  --fixture /tmp/imported-arena-pack \
  --manifest /tmp/imported-arena-pack/PACK.json
```

The signature is a deterministic SHA-256 content digest for integrity checks. Optional signer metadata adds an `identity_digest` so edited signer fields fail `arena verify`; it is provenance metadata, not private-key signing.

Compare two Arena result files:

```bash
./bin/shipguard arena compare \
  --left /tmp/arena-old/results.json \
  --right /tmp/arena-new/results.json \
  --out /tmp/arena-compare
```

The command writes `arena-compare.json` and `arena-compare.md`. It reports score, case-count, high-risk, added-case, removed-case, and per-case deltas so benchmark changes are reviewable instead of implied by a new average.

## Transcript Redaction

Redact a maintainer transcript before publishing it as an example, benchmark note, or public proof:

```bash
./bin/shipguard transcript redact \
  --in raw-transcript.md \
  --out /tmp/redacted-transcript.md \
  --report /tmp/redaction-report.json \
  --private-term "InternalProjectName"
```

The command writes redacted Markdown and a JSON report. It redacts emails, token-like values, secret assignments, local user paths, long hex strings, bearer tokens, and custom private terms. See `transcript-redaction.md`.

Verify a redacted transcript and optional redaction report:

```bash
./bin/shipguard transcript verify \
  --in /tmp/redacted-transcript.md \
  --report /tmp/redaction-report.json \
  --out /tmp/transcript-verify
```

The command writes `transcript-verify.json`, `transcript-verify.md`, and `badge.json`. It exits non-zero when risky content remains.

Build a public-safe transcript corpus index:

```bash
./bin/shipguard transcript corpus \
  --source fixtures/transcripts \
  --out /tmp/transcript-corpus \
  --require-report true
```

The command writes `corpus.json`, `index.md`, `badge.json`, and per-case verification reports under `runs/`. It exits non-zero when any transcript verification is blocked or when `--require-report true` is set and a case is missing `redaction-report.json`. See `transcript-corpus.md`.

## Review Comment

Generate a PR-ready comment and Shields-compatible badge from an autopsy report:

```bash
./bin/shipguard review-comment \
  --report /tmp/autopsy/report.json \
  --out /tmp/review/comment.md \
  --badge /tmp/review/badge.json \
  --artifact-dir /tmp/review \
  --mode warn
```

Use `--mode fail` to exit non-zero when the report is blocked. See `pr-review-bot.md` for the GitHub Actions workflow shape.

## CI Gate

Run Autopsy, review-comment, badge generation, and gate JSON in one command:

```bash
./bin/shipguard ci-gate \
  --run run.md \
  --diff change.patch \
  --tests test.log \
  --policy .shipguard/policy.conf \
  --out artifacts/shipguard-gate \
  --mode warn
```

Use `--mode fail` when blocked gates should fail CI. See `ci-gate.md`.

## CI Summary

Generate GitHub Actions step-summary Markdown from `gate.json`:

```bash
./bin/shipguard ci-summary \
  --gate /tmp/codex-gate/gate.json \
  --out /tmp/codex-gate/summary.md
```

`ci-gate` writes `summary.md` automatically. See `ci-summary.md`.

## Check Run

Generate a GitHub Checks API payload from `gate.json`:

```bash
./bin/shipguard check-run \
  --gate /tmp/codex-gate/gate.json \
  --head-sha "$GITHUB_SHA" \
  --out /tmp/codex-gate/check-run/payload.json
```

Post the payload only when the workflow has an explicit token and `checks: write` permission:

```bash
./bin/shipguard check-run post \
  --payload /tmp/codex-gate/check-run/payload.json \
  --repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" \
  --out /tmp/codex-gate/check-run/response.json
```

Use `--dry-run` to write the request metadata without contacting GitHub. The reusable CI gate action writes this payload into the artifact bundle and can post it when `post-check-run` is enabled. See `check-run.md`.

## SARIF

Convert an Autopsy report into SARIF 2.1.0:

```bash
./bin/shipguard sarif \
  --report /tmp/autopsy/report.json \
  --out /tmp/autopsy/results.sarif
```

`ci-gate` writes `sarif/results.sarif` automatically. See `sarif.md`.

## Docs Check

Check Markdown files for broken local links:

```bash
./bin/shipguard docs-check . --out /tmp/shipguard-docs-check
```

External URLs and in-page anchors are ignored. The command writes `docs-check.json` and `docs-check.md` when `--out` is provided. See `docs-check.md`.

## Codex Status

Check whether the local Codex plugin cache has a ShipGuard-related plugin install and whether it looks current:

```bash
./bin/shipguard codex status
```

Use `--cache` for fixture caches or non-default Codex plugin locations, and `--strict` when stale or missing installs should fail the command:

```bash
./bin/shipguard codex status --cache /tmp/codex-plugin-cache --strict
```

The command is read-only. It reports installed `ios-shipguard` plugin metadata, old repository URLs, old `Shipguard` casing, old `codex-maintainer` guidance, whether tracked plugin source exists in the checkout, whether a matching ShipGuard CLI resolves from the install or current package, and the exact refresh handoff for Git source, plugin cache, and new Codex threads. See `codex-status.md`.

## Leaderboard

Build a stable public leaderboard JSON file from arena results:

```bash
./bin/shipguard leaderboard build \
  --arena-results /tmp/arena/results.json \
  --out /tmp/leaderboard.json
```

See `benchmark.md` for the schema and `demo-reports.md` for checked-in generated examples.

## Release Manifest

Generate release proof files for a tarball:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-manifest \
  --tarball dist/shipguard-v3.113.0.tar.gz \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-proof
```

Verify the manifest against the tarball:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-manifest verify \
  --manifest /tmp/shipguard-release-proof/release-manifest.json \
  --tarball dist/shipguard-v3.113.0.tar.gz
```

The command writes `release-manifest.json` and `proof-ledger.md`. Add `--ci-run-url`, `--release-url`, and `--issue-url` after publishing to bind the local artifact digest to public release proof. See `release-manifest.md`.

Build a release proof catalog from manifests:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-index build \
  --manifest dist/release-proof-v3.5.0/release-manifest.json \
  --manifest dist/release-proof-v3.113.0/release-manifest.json \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-index
```

The command writes `release-index.json` and `release-index.md`. See `release-index.md`.

Replay-verify downloaded release assets:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-replay verify \
  --manifest /tmp/shipguard-release-proof/release-manifest.json \
  --tarball /tmp/shipguard-release-assets/shipguard-v3.113.0.tar.gz \
  --index /tmp/shipguard-release-index/release-index.json \
  --ledger /tmp/shipguard-release-proof/proof-ledger.md \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-replay
```

The command writes `replay-report.json` and `replay-report.md`. See `release-replay.md`.

Build a compact release attestation:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-attest build \
  --manifest /tmp/shipguard-release-proof/release-manifest.json \
  --replay /tmp/shipguard-release-replay/replay-report.json \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-attestation
```

The command writes `attestation.json`, `attestation.md`, and `attestation-badge.json`. See `release-attest.md`.

Build the full release proof bundle in one command:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-proof build \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-proof-bundle \
  --release-url https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v3.113.0
```

The command writes the release tarball, manifest, release index, replay report, attestation, and attestation badge. See `release-proof.md`.

## Release Consume

Verify a flat directory of downloaded release assets and write a consumer report:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-consume verify \
  --dir /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0 \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/consumer-proof \
  --version 3.113.0
```

The command writes `consumer-report.json`, `consumer-report.md`, `asset-digests.json`, `asset-digests.md`, `sha256.txt`, replay outputs, and attestation outputs. It also cross-checks downloaded replay, attestation, and badge assets when they are present. Use `actions/release-consume` when this verification should run in GitHub Actions. See `release-consume.md` and `release-consume-action.md`.

## Release Diff

Compare two release proof asset directories and write JSON/Markdown diff reports:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-diff compare \
  --left /tmp/shipguard-old \
  --right /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0 \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-diff
```

The command accepts flat GitHub release downloads or nested `release-proof build` output. It compares release tarballs, manifests, indexes, ledgers, replay reports, attestations, and badges. Use `actions/release-diff` when this comparison should run in GitHub Actions. See `release-diff.md` and `release-diff-action.md`.

## Release Evidence

Export release proof reports as a static evidence page:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-evidence site \
  --consume /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/consumer-proof \
  --diff /tmp/shipguard-release-diff \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-site
```

The command writes `index.html`, `evidence.json`, `README.md`, and source JSON copies under `sources/`. Use `actions/release-evidence` when this export should run in GitHub Actions. See `release-evidence-site.md` and `release-evidence-action.md`.

Build a static index from one or more evidence site exports:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-evidence index \
  --site /tmp/shipguard-previous-site \
  --site /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0-site \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-history
```

The command writes `index.html`, `evidence-index.json`, `README.md`, and copied site exports under `sites/`. Use `actions/release-evidence` with `build-index: true` when this index should run in GitHub Actions. See `release-evidence-index.md` and `release-evidence-action.md`.

Build the full local evidence path from downloaded release assets:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-evidence bundle \
  --assets /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0 \
  --left /tmp/shipguard-old \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-evidence-bundle \
  --version 3.113.0 \
  --title "ShipGuard v3.113.0 Evidence"
```

The command writes consumer proof, optional release-diff proof, `site/index.html`, `index/evidence-index.json`, `bundle.json`, and `README.md`. See `release-evidence-bundle.md`.

Verify a downloaded release evidence artifact:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-evidence verify \
  --dir /tmp/shipguard-release-evidence \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-release-evidence-verify \
  --require-diff true \
  --require-index true
```

The command writes `evidence-verify.json`, `evidence-verify.md`, and `badge.json`. It checks the static evidence site, copied source reports, optional evidence index, and optional `bundle.json` for consistency. Use `actions/release-evidence-verify` when this consumption proof should run in GitHub Actions. See `release-evidence-verify.md`.

Run the checked-in negative fixture pack as a single guardrail index:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-evidence negative-index \
  --fixture fixtures/release-evidence/negative \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-negative-evidence
```

The command reads `cases.tsv`, runs each intentionally broken fixture through `release-evidence verify`, and writes `index.html`, `negative-fixture-index.json`, `negative-fixture-index.md`, `badge.json`, and per-case verifier outputs under `runs/<case>/`. It exits successfully only when every case blocks on the expected failed check.

Use `actions/release-evidence-negative-index` when this guardrail index should run in GitHub Actions. See `release-evidence-negative-index-action.md`.

## Release Proof Consumption

Download a published release bundle, verify the tarball digest, replay the proof, and rebuild the compact attestation:

```bash
gh release download v3.113.0 \
  --repo jlekerli-source/ShipGuard \
  --pattern 'shipguard-v3.113.0.tar.gz' \
  --pattern 'release-manifest.json' \
  --pattern 'release-index.json' \
  --pattern 'proof-ledger.md' \
  --pattern 'attestation-badge.json' \
  --dir /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0

shasum -a 256 /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/shipguard-v3.113.0.tar.gz

./bin/shipguard release-replay verify \
  --manifest /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/release-manifest.json \
  --tarball /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/shipguard-v3.113.0.tar.gz \
  --index /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/release-index.json \
  --ledger /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/proof-ledger.md \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/consumer-replay

./bin/shipguard release-attest build \
  --manifest /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/release-manifest.json \
  --replay /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/consumer-replay/replay-report.json \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v3.113.0/consumer-attestation
```

See `release-proof-consumption.md` for the rejection rules and trust model.

## Self-Audit

Generate release-readiness proof for the toolkit itself:

```bash
./bin/shipguard self-audit --out /tmp/shipguard-self-audit
```

The command writes:

- `self-audit.md`
- `self-audit.json`

It checks stable command availability and the core artifacts that make the Maintainer Reliability OS useful: policy config, CI gate action, review-comment action, demo leaderboard, and demo arena results.

See `maintainer-reliability-os.md`, `command-matrix.md`, and `release-checklist.md`.

## Next Goal

Generate slash-plan and slash-goal guidance for the next release:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

Override the target release and title when the next improvement is already known:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal \
  --release 2.2.0 \
  --title "SARIF Evidence Export" \
  --out /tmp/next-goal.md
```

When the scope is already chosen, include it in the generated `/plan` and `/goal`:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal \
  --release 2.2.0 \
  --title "Scoped Goal Handoff" \
  --scope "Make next-goal emit scoped plans and completion receipts." \
  --out /tmp/scoped-next-goal.md
```

After the slice is complete, add caller-supplied proof evidence and the title for the following goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal \
  --release 2.2.0 \
  --title "Scoped Goal Handoff" \
  --scope "Make next-goal emit scoped plans and completion receipts." \
  --completion-evidence "./tests/next_goal_test.sh and ./tests/package_release_test.sh passed" \
  --following-title "Next Reliability Slice" \
  --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

The command writes a Markdown plan with `/plan` and `/goal` blocks, optional bounded scope and completion receipt sections, release constraints, Brand Deck strict proof for public surface naming changes, proof commands, publishing checks, and the command to generate the following goal. See `next-goal.md`.

## Install From Release Tarball

Download and extract a release package:

```bash
tar -xzf shipguard-v3.113.0.tar.gz
cd shipguard-v3.113.0
PREFIX="$HOME/.local" ./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer copies toolkit files into `${PREFIX:-/usr/local}/lib/shipguard` and writes a `shipguard` wrapper into `${PREFIX:-/usr/local}/bin`.

## Package Contents

Release packages include the CLI, compatibility wrappers, scripts, skills, templates, examples, demo fixtures, docs, scorecard, planning templates, and license. They exclude `.git`, `dist`, generated caches, and local machine paths.

See `compatibility.md` for the legacy wrapper policy.
