# GitHub Action

This repo exposes reusable composite actions for validating a workflow-bundle checkout, building release proof artifacts, and consuming published release proof assets.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Validate Codex workflow bundle

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate Codex workflow bundle
        uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/validate@v3.13.0
```

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | `.` | Path to validate. |

## Release Proof Action

```yaml
- name: Build release proof
  uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-proof@v3.13.0
  with:
    release-url: https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v3.13.0
    issue-url: https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
```

The action builds the release tarball, manifest, release index, replay report, attestation, and attestation badge, then uploads them as an artifact. See `release-proof-action.md`, `release-proof-workflows.md`, and `release-proof-consumption.md`.

## Release Consume Action

```yaml
- name: Verify published proof assets
  uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-consume@v3.13.0
  with:
    repo: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows
    release-tag: v3.13.0
    mode: fail
```

The action downloads release assets with `gh release download`, runs `codex-maintainer release-consume verify`, uploads the consumer proof bundle, and exposes paths for `consumer-report.json`, `asset-digests.json`, `sha256.txt`, and the regenerated attestation badge. See `release-consume-action.md`.

## Local Action Development

This repository uses the validation action against itself in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Validate through reusable action
  uses: ./actions/validate
```
