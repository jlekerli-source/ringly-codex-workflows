# GitHub Action

This repo exposes reusable composite actions for validating a workflow-bundle checkout, building release proof artifacts, consuming published release proof assets, comparing release proof, exporting release evidence, and verifying downloaded evidence artifacts.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Validate Codex workflow bundle

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate Codex workflow bundle
        uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/validate@v3.21.0
```

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | `.` | Path to validate. |

## Release Proof Action

```yaml
- name: Build release proof
  uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-proof@v3.21.0
  with:
    release-url: https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v3.21.0
    issue-url: https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
```

The action builds the release tarball, manifest, release index, replay report, attestation, and attestation badge, then uploads them as an artifact. See `release-proof-action.md`, `release-proof-workflows.md`, and `release-proof-consumption.md`.

## Release Consume Action

```yaml
- name: Verify published proof assets
  uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-consume@v3.21.0
  with:
    repo: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows
    release-tag: v3.21.0
    mode: fail
```

The action downloads release assets with `gh release download`, runs `codex-maintainer release-consume verify`, uploads the consumer proof bundle, and exposes paths for `consumer-report.json`, `asset-digests.json`, `sha256.txt`, and the regenerated attestation badge. See `release-consume-action.md`.

## Release Diff Action

```yaml
- name: Compare published proof assets
  uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-diff@v3.21.0
  with:
    repo: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows
    left-tag: v0.0.0
    right-tag: v3.21.0
    mode: fail
```

The action downloads both releases, runs `codex-maintainer release-diff compare`, uploads the diff report, and exposes paths for `release-diff.json` and `release-diff.md`. See `release-diff-action.md`.

## Release Evidence Action

```yaml
- name: Export release evidence
  uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-evidence@v3.21.0
  with:
    title: Codex Maintainer Release Evidence
    include-diff: auto
    build-index: true
    mode: fail
```

The action runs `codex-maintainer release-evidence site`, optionally runs `codex-maintainer release-evidence index`, uploads the static evidence artifact, and exposes paths for `evidence.json` and `evidence-index.json`. See `release-evidence-action.md`.

## Release Evidence Bundle Action

```yaml
- name: Build release evidence bundle
  uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-evidence@v3.21.0
  with:
    run: bundle
    repo: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows
    release-tag: v3.21.0
    previous-tag: v3.19.0
    download-assets: true
    mode: fail
```

Bundle mode downloads release assets, runs `codex-maintainer release-evidence bundle`, uploads consumer proof, optional release diff proof, static evidence site, evidence index, and `bundle.json`. See `release-evidence-action.md` and `release-evidence-bundle.md`.

## Release Evidence Verify Action

```yaml
- name: Verify release evidence artifact
  uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-evidence-verify@v3.21.0
  with:
    dir: artifacts/codex-maintainer-release-evidence
    require-diff: true
    require-index: true
    mode: fail
```

Use this after `actions/download-artifact` to prove an evidence artifact produced by `actions/release-evidence` can be consumed independently. The action runs `codex-maintainer release-evidence verify`, uploads `evidence-verify.json`, `evidence-verify.md`, and `badge.json`, and exposes those paths as outputs. See `release-evidence-verify.md`.

## Local Action Development

This repository uses the validation action against itself in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Validate through reusable action
  uses: ./actions/validate
```
