# Release Diff Action

`actions/release-diff` compares two published release proof asset sets in GitHub Actions. It can download both releases with `gh release download`, run `shipguard release-diff compare`, and upload `release-diff.json` plus `release-diff.md`.

## Usage

```yaml

  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      left-tag:
        description: Older release tag.
        required: true
