# Template Profiles

`shipguard init` supports workflow starter profiles for different app types.

Every profile writes a target-repo `SHIPGUARD_PROFILE.md` next to `AGENTS.md`. That file is the developer-facing handoff for the selected starter profile: first commands, profile intent, and the next local customization work before using Codex on production code. Shared starter files such as `PLANS.md` and `SUBAGENTS.md` come from `templates/common/` so initialized target repos do not receive ShipGuard-maintainer-only guidance.

## iOS

```bash
./bin/shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard doctor ios ../my-ios-app
```

The iOS profile includes alarm, notification, release, bug-triage, and UI-polish skills. Each starter skill also carries ShipGuard QA hooks so `shipguard value-gauntlet` can verify it has command examples, validation language, docs linkage, and test coverage.

| Skill | Path | Primary use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| alarm-testing | `.agents/skills/alarm-testing/SKILL.md` | Alarm runtime and wake-path proof routing. |
| notification-permissions | `.agents/skills/notification-permissions/SKILL.md` | Notification, AlarmKit, fallback, and permission-truth checks. |
| release-checklist | `.agents/skills/release-checklist/SKILL.md` | Release readiness, TestFlight handoff, and proof claims. |
| bug-triage | `.agents/skills/bug-triage/SKILL.md` | Bug report classification before implementation. |
| ui-polish | `.agents/skills/ui-polish/SKILL.md` | UI/UX polish with accessibility, localization, and visual-proof boundaries. |

## Web

```bash
./bin/shipguard init web ../my-web-app
./bin/shipguard doctor web ../my-web-app
./bin/shipguard web audit --path ../my-web-app --out /tmp/shipguard-web-audit --shareable
./bin/shipguard web plan --report /tmp/shipguard-web-audit --target ../my-web-app --out /tmp/shipguard-web-plan --shareable
```

The web profile copies the shared maintainer workflow files, `SHIPGUARD_PROFILE.md`, and a web-specific `AGENTS.md` that covers routing, auth, payments, migrations, browser validation, and build proof. ShipGuard WebScan turns real target files into a read-only first audit with framework, auth/payment, validation, starter-health, scan-transparency, and next-command evidence; generated ShipGuard starter files are not counted as target proof. ShipGuard WebForge then turns the audit into scoped tasks, validation commands, validation receipts, validation rerun receipts, stop conditions, and report-quality questions without editing the target repo.

## Backend

```bash
./bin/shipguard init backend ../my-service
./bin/shipguard doctor backend ../my-service
./bin/shipguard backend audit --path ../my-service --out /tmp/shipguard-backend-audit --shareable
./bin/shipguard backend plan --report /tmp/shipguard-backend-audit --target ../my-service --out /tmp/shipguard-backend-plan --shareable
```

The backend profile writes `SHIPGUARD_PROFILE.md` and covers API endpoints, auth boundaries, migrations, queues, jobs, webhooks, observability, rollout risk, and operational proof. ShipGuard ServiceRadar turns real target files into a read-only first audit with validation guidance, scan-transparency, and backend-specific next commands; generated ShipGuard starter files are not counted as target proof. ShipGuard ServiceForge then turns the audit into scoped backend tasks, validation commands, validation receipts, validation rerun receipts, stop conditions, and report-quality questions without contacting services or editing code.

## CLI

```bash
./bin/shipguard init cli ../my-tool
./bin/shipguard doctor cli ../my-tool
./bin/shipguard cli audit --path ../my-tool --out /tmp/shipguard-cli-audit --shareable
./bin/shipguard cli plan --report /tmp/shipguard-cli-audit --target ../my-tool --out /tmp/shipguard-cli-plan --shareable
```

The CLI profile writes `SHIPGUARD_PROFILE.md` and covers command dispatch, argument parsing, file safety, stdout and stderr contracts, exit codes, token redaction, cross-platform behavior, and package proof. ShipGuard CommandLens turns real target files into a read-only first audit with contract, redaction, packaging, validation, scan-transparency, and next-command guidance; generated ShipGuard starter files are not counted as target proof. ShipGuard CommandForge then turns the audit into scoped CLI contract tasks, smoke checks, validation commands, validation receipts, validation rerun receipts, stop conditions, and report-quality questions without executing the target CLI.

## Compatibility

These commands remain valid:

```bash
./bin/shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard doctor ../my-ios-app
```

`doctor` without a profile defaults to `ios` for compatibility with older releases.
