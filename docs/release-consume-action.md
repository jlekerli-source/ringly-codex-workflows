# Release Consume Action

`actions/release-consume` verifies published release proof assets in GitHub Actions. It can download a release with `gh release download`, run `codex-maintainer release-consume verify`, and upload the consumer proof bundle as a workflow artifact.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Verify Codex maintainer release proof

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      release-tag:
        description: Release tag to verify.
        required: true
        default: v3.39.0

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Verify published proof assets
        uses: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows/actions/release-consume@v3.39.0
        with:
          repo: jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows
          release-tag: ${{ inputs.release-tag }}
          mode: fail
```

## Outputs

- `status`
- `consumer-report`
- `consumer-report-md`
- `asset-digests`
- `asset-digests-md`
- `sha256`
- `attestation-badge`

The uploaded artifact contains `consumer-report.json`, `consumer-report.md`, `asset-digests.json`, `asset-digests.md`, `sha256.txt`, replay proof, and regenerated attestation proof.
