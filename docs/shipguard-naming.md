# ShipGuard Naming

ShipGuard should feel like a real product, not a pile of generic helper scripts. Public CLI commands stay literal because they need to be searchable, scriptable, and boring in CI. The personality lives in branded surface names, report headings, section names, docs, and aliases.

The rule is simple: a fun name is allowed only when its plain job and proof boundary are visible beside it.

## Naming Rules

- Keep CLI verbs literal and searchable; add personality through surface names, section labels, and report copy.
- Pair every branded surface with a plain-purpose sentence and a proof-boundary sentence.
- Use short techy nouns from the ShipGuard universe: Deck, Dock, Radar, Forge, Lens, Port, Vault, Bay, Arena, Engine, Lab, Tower, Beacon, Rail, Rig, Harbor, and Compass.
- Avoid app-specific branding in reusable surfaces. Private app names belong only in read-only product-QA evidence.
- Never let a vibe label weaken proof language. Release, payment, privacy, haptic, performance, and simulator claims stay literal.
- New public surfaces must update `shipguard brand`, docs, skill routing, self-audit, package proof, and focused tests.
- Make the nitty-gritty fun through call signs in human-facing output, not by renaming automation-sensitive files.

## Product Places

| Name | Plain Purpose | Where It Appears | Proof Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ShipGuard ShipYard | The workshop layer for the whole toolkit: commands, docs, tests, fixtures, plugins, packages, and proof loops. | README, Brand Deck reports, naming docs, release handoffs, and human-facing summaries. | ShipYard names the workspace experience; it is not a repo rename and does not change automation paths. |

## Nitty-Gritty Call Signs

Use these labels when reports, logs, docs, or CI summaries refer to file families. The physical file paths stay literal so scripts, CI, packages, and docs links remain stable.

| Path Pattern | Call Sign | Example Label | Plain Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/*.sh` | Deckhand Scripts | `[deckhand]` | Small shell operators that move validation, packaging, and proof work forward. |
| `scripts/ios_*.py` | Sonar Modules | `[sonar]` | Python scanners that read source, classify risk, and emit structured iOS reports. |
| `tests/*_test.sh` | Gauntlet Runs | `[gauntlet]` | Repeatable tests that prove a ShipGuard behavior did not drift. |
| `actions/*/action.yml` | Signal Flares | `[flare]` | GitHub Action entrypoints that publish ShipGuard proof into CI. |
| `fixtures/**` | Proof Playground | `[playground]` | Synthetic public cases that make report quality and routing behavior testable. |
| `*.json` | Blackbox Receipts | `[blackbox]` | Machine-readable evidence, status, findings, and release metadata. |
| `*.md` | Bridge Notes | `[bridge]` | Human-readable handoffs, reports, docs, and release summaries. |
| `*.log` | Engine Tapes | `[engine]` | Raw command output, build traces, profiler notes, and failure trails. |
| `dist/*.tar.gz` | Cargo Crates | `[cargo]` | Release packages that users can unpack and verify outside the source checkout. |
| `plugins/**` | Docking Gear | `[dock]` | Codex plugin metadata, skills, and MCP launch configuration. |

## Future Naming Contract

Before shipping a new command or major report surface:

1. Add the literal CLI command to `bin/shipguard`.
2. Add a branded surface row to `scripts/ios_branding.py`.
3. Mention the surface here and in `docs/command-matrix.md`.
4. Add skill or eval routing when a user would ask for the surface by name.
5. Add or reuse an artifact call sign for any new script, log, fixture, package, or plugin family.
6. Add self-audit, package, and focused tests.
7. Run `./bin/shipguard brand --path . --out /tmp/shipguard-brand --strict`.

Do not rename stable public commands only for flavor. ShipGuard can be vibey in reports and docs while keeping automation-safe CLI names.
