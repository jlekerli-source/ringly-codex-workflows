# Adoption Guide

Use this guide when you want to bring the workflow kit into another repository without copying Ringly-specific assumptions blindly.

## The First 30 Minutes

1. Clone or open this repository.
2. Run the local validator:

```bash
./bin/shipguard validate
```

3. Initialize a starter profile into a test project:

```bash
./bin/shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard init web ../my-web-app
./bin/shipguard init backend ../my-service
./bin/shipguard init cli ../my-tool
```

4. Open the generated `AGENTS.md` and replace:

- `[APP_NAME]`
- `[XCODE_PROJECT]`
- `[APP_SOURCE_DIRECTORY]`
- `[TEST_DIRECTORY]`
- placeholder validation commands
- profile-specific high-risk areas that do not apply to your repo

5. Run the doctor check:

```bash
./bin/shipguard doctor ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard doctor web ../my-web-app
./bin/shipguard doctor backend ../my-service
./bin/shipguard doctor cli ../my-tool
```

6. Copy one prompt from `examples/prompt-pack.md` and test it on a small, low-risk issue.

## What To Customize First

- Project overview and source paths.
- Real validation commands.
- Protected files and high-risk areas.
- Release and proof rules.
- Product-specific permission, payment, persistence, localization, and lifecycle risks.

## What Not To Copy Blindly

- Ringly-specific alarm assumptions if your app is not alarm-related.
- Web-specific auth, payment, migration, or browser-test assumptions if your app does not use them.
- Backend-specific migration, queue, webhook, or rollout assumptions if your repo is not a service.
- CLI-specific stdout, exit-code, package, or cross-platform assumptions if your repo is not a CLI.
- Commands that do not exist in your repo.
- Release proof rules that do not match your App Store, TestFlight, or deployment process.
- Any text that implies stronger reliability than your product can prove.

## Definition Of Adopted

The workflow is adopted when:

- `AGENTS.md` describes your real app.
- `PLANS.md` is used before risky work.
- At least one skill maps to a recurring task.
- CI runs the validation action or an equivalent local check.
- The maintainer can score a Codex run with `SCORECARD.md`.
