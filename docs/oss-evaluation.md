These private-app runs are not app remediation plans. They are read-only samples used to evaluate whether ShipGuard reports are specific, prioritized, low-noise, and useful enough to turn into public fixtures or eval cases. The Ringly and Ilmify evidence showed ShipGuard needed the eval boundary on more than performance, plus rule summaries and capped Markdown for noisy modernize, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness reports while keeping complete JSON.

A later read-only Ringly/Ilmify pass showed two additional ShipGuard weaknesses: iOS source scanners could spend too much time traversing generated/proof/cache folders in large app checkouts, and `ios design` app-type inference over-weighted repeated instruction-document wording. The scanners now share a skip-scope helper, reports disclose skipped directories, and design app-type scoring prefers Swift/project signals with capped document contributions.

A subsequent read-only Ringly/Ilmify report-quality pass showed `ios design --shipguard-eval` was still useful but not shareable by default because the JSON carried the local app root. `ios design --shareable` now omits local absolute roots and preview directories from report fields before report-quality scoring or external planning, while default local reports keep operator paths.

The Build iOS Apps integration pass showed ShipGuard had useful references to XcodeBuildMCP, simulator browser, SwiftUI preview, and profiler workflows, but no single ShipGuard command that made those workflows feel native. `shipguard ios build-apps` now inspects repo topology, recommends the right Build iOS Apps route, emits XcodeBuildMCP build/run, debugger/log, simulator browser, SwiftUI preview hot reload, and performance profiler handoffs, and keeps the execution boundary honest: ShipGuard owns routing and proof reports, while Build iOS Apps executes Codex simulator/debugger/profiler tools.

The next Build iOS Apps QA pass showed that a good route report still was not enough: ShipGuard could not tell whether Codex actually ran `build_run_sim`, captured a UI snapshot, opened `serve-sim`, hot-reloaded a SwiftUI preview, or preserved an Animation Hitches/Time Profiler receipt. `shipguard ios build-apps --receipt <file-or-dir>` now grades explicit proof bundles after execution and flags missing lane-specific evidence while keeping the target app read-only.

The next read-only loop showed the report-quality artifact itself still carried absolute input/report paths even when its source design reports were shareable. `ios report-quality --shareable` now omits local absolute input and report paths from its own JSON, Markdown, findings, and redaction commands before ChatGPT/GitHub/docs/release-evidence sharing.

A follow-up read-only loop over the full Ringly/Ilmify report set showed another report-quality gap: the source reports carried useful `reportQualityQuestions`, but the quality artifact ended with only generic next actions. `ios report-quality` now aggregates those questions into an `Actionability Questions` section so the next ShipGuard rule, fixture, report section, or docs improvement is explicit.

The next performance explanation pass showed the quality loop could keep prioritizing "why does this matter?" even when `ios performance` already emitted an impact column. Report-quality now verifies `ios performance` findings have an `impact` or `whyItMatters` field and that Markdown surfaces the explanation, while the performance product-QA questions move on to grouping, evidence, proof, and fixture usefulness.

The next repeated-performance pass used a public read-only fixture with many high findings from the same rules. It showed that `ruleSummary` existed, but Markdown still repeated the same high rule rows before giving a rule-level action. `ios performance` now emits `groupedActionPlan`, renders `Grouped Next Actions` before capped individual findings, and `ios report-quality` flags repeated performance reports that omit either JSON grouping or visible Markdown grouping.

The following high-evidence pass showed high findings had source snippets and impact text, but no explicit explanation for why severity was `high`. `ios performance` now emits `severityReason` for findings, renders it as `Why severity` in grouped and top-finding Markdown tables, and `ios report-quality` flags high performance findings that omit the JSON reason or hide it from Markdown. The next product-QA priority moved to local-vs-manual proof guidance.

The next proof-boundary pass showed performance findings still used one blended proof sentence. `ios performance` now emits `localProof` and `manualProof`, renders `Codex local proof` and `Manual/device proof` in Markdown, and `ios report-quality` flags performance reports that omit those split fields or hide them from Markdown. The next product-QA priority moved to whether grouped actions name the smallest first experiment before broad refactors.

A public read-only full-report pass then showed report-quality still prioritized that first-experiment question because grouped performance actions had only broad `recommendedFirstMove` text. `ios performance` now emits a `firstExperiment` for each grouped action, Markdown renders a `First experiment` column before broader first-move advice, and `ios report-quality` emits `performance-grouped-first-experiment-missing` or `performance-markdown-first-experiment-missing` when grouped actions hide the smallest reversible proof step.

The next public fixture plus read-only Ringly/Ilmify performance pass showed the same remaining report-quality weakness: first experiments were present, but the grouped action did not make the validation route and stop condition explicit as report data. `ios performance` now emits `validationRoute` and `stopCondition` for each grouped action, Markdown renders those columns, and `ios report-quality` emits grouped or Markdown findings when validation routes or stop conditions are missing.

A real plugin run from an app checkout showed the iOS skill tried the app-local `./bin/shipguard` path and then fell back to source inspection because the Codex plugin bundle does not install the CLI into every target repo. The skill now resolves `SHIPGUARD_CLI` from app-local `./bin/shipguard`, installed `shipguard`, or `$HOME/.local/bin/shipguard`, and the docs clarify that plugin install loads skill metadata while CLI install provides the executable.

The next read-only performance pass showed `ios performance --shipguard-eval` still carried absolute local project roots, so report-quality correctly raised a local-path shareability warning. `ios performance --shareable` now omits local absolute project paths from JSON and Markdown before report-quality scoring or external planning, while default local reports keep operator paths.

The next remaining-shareability pass over modernize, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness showed no local path leaks in real-app reports, but those reports had no explicit shareability contract. `ios modernize --shareable`, `ios app-intelligence --shareable`, and `ios ai-readiness --shareable` now record shareability metadata and Markdown mode lines so report-quality passes are intentional rather than accidental.

The next declared-shareability pass showed `ios report-quality --shareable` still passed local-mode source reports when their contents happened not to leak paths. Report-quality now emits `declared-shareability-missing` for source reports without shareability metadata and `declared-shareability-local-mode` for reports that explicitly declare local mode, while regenerated shareable Ringly/Ilmify reports continue to pass.

The next read-only Ringly/Ilmify design and performance pass produced structurally clean report-quality output with useful actionability questions, but ShipGuard still lacked a first-class way to convert those questions into governed implementation work. `ios spec-workflow` now generates ShipGuard-owned constitution, feature spec, implementation plan, tasks, analysis gates, slash plan/goal, and Devspace guardrails from a feature or report-quality artifact so private-app observations become ShipGuard product work instead of app remediation tasks.

A follow-up misuse probe showed a shareable spec workflow generated without `--from-report` still passed report-quality even though it was not grounded in observed ShipGuard output. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-report-context-missing` and `spec-workflow-actionability-missing` for that case, so polished-looking spec artifacts need real report evidence before they pass adoption scoring.

The next spec-workflow completeness probe removed a declared generated file from an otherwise valid bundle. Report-quality now dereferences the spec-workflow artifact manifest and emits `spec-workflow-artifact-file-missing` for incomplete bundles while keeping shareable output free of local absolute paths.

The next content-quality probe replaced valid `tasks.md` and `devspace-guardrails.md` files with placeholder text. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-artifact-content-incomplete` and `spec-workflow-artifact-placeholder-content`, so present-but-useless generated files no longer pass adoption scoring.

The next question-coverage probe replaced the generated clarifying questions with a generic question while leaving the spec bundle structurally valid. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-question-coverage-missing` and `spec-workflow-question-artifact-missing`, so report-grounded spec workflows must preserve the source actionability questions in JSON and Markdown.

The next task-coverage probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could pass even when `taskPlan` and `tasks.md` stayed generic and answered none of the source actionability questions. Spec-workflow now creates `S007+` proof-gated tasks for those questions, and report-quality emits `spec-workflow-task-coverage-missing` or `spec-workflow-task-artifact-missing` if a bundle drops them.

The next acceptance-criteria probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could still pass when `featureSpec.acceptanceCriteria` and `feature-spec.md` stayed generic. Spec-workflow now turns deduplicated report-quality actionability questions into acceptance criteria as well as tasks, and report-quality emits `spec-workflow-acceptance-coverage-missing` or `spec-workflow-acceptance-artifact-missing` if a bundle drops them.

The next validation-command probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could pass even when `technicalPlan.recommendedValidation` was empty and `implementation-plan.md` only said validation needed maintainer selection. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-validation-coverage-missing` or `spec-workflow-validation-artifact-missing` when the spec workflow drops exact proof commands.

The next analysis-gate probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could pass after `analysisGates` and `implementation-plan.md` were reduced to a generic maintainer-selection placeholder. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-analysis-coverage-missing` or `spec-workflow-analysis-artifact-missing` when the spec workflow drops the required pre-implementation analysis gates.

The next slash-handoff probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could pass after `slashPlan`, `slashGoal`, and `ios-spec-workflow.md` were reduced to generic "plan later" placeholders. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-slash-handoff-incomplete` or `spec-workflow-slash-handoff-artifact-missing` when a spec bundle drops the copy-ready `/plan` and `/goal` next-loop handoff.

The next read-only spec-workflow loop over public demo reports showed repeated actionability questions could consume the first-eight clarifying-question cap and hide a later unique question. Spec-workflow now deduplicates report-quality questions before applying clarifying-question and task caps, and the regression fixture verifies the generated JSON and Markdown pass report-quality.

The next source-integration review showed the external-repo learning was still too shallow: ShipGuard described checklist/analyze-style workflow inspiration, but did not emit a real requirements checklist or consistency analysis artifact. Spec-workflow now creates `requirements-checklist.md` as planning-requirement unit tests and `consistency-analysis.md` as a cross-artifact coverage review, records ShipGuard-owned adaptation notes for Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Xcode Build Optimization Agent Skills, and the OpenAI native iOS preview loop, and report-quality requires those artifacts before adoption passes.

The next read-only Ringly/Ilmify loop passed report-quality structurally but still showed that "fully integrated" external learning needed an explicit replace/extend/keep/defer decision layer. Spec-workflow now emits `integration-decisions.md` and JSON `integrationDecisions`, evaluates each external workflow idea against the current ShipGuard surface, states what it replaces or keeps, and gives validation evidence. Report-quality now requires that decision artifact and checks it preserves the report-quality questions before adoption passes.

The next external-source review showed even that was still too static: Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, and social-post ideas were represented as hardcoded inspiration inside spec-workflow instead of a repeatable source audit. `ios external-audit` now records read-only source checkouts and URLs, classifies source capabilities, emits a native replacement ledger, states what ShipGuard replaces, extends, keeps, routes, or defers, and carries license/no-vendoring boundaries plus report-quality questions. A source is not considered integrated until its capability has a ShipGuard-native action and validation command.

The next design-source pass used the installed Design Motion Principles skill as a read-only input and exposed a classifier weakness: the Expo profile could match `EAS` inside ordinary words such as `easing`. External-audit now uses boundary-aware source signals and has a first-class Design Motion Principles profile; `ios design` emits ShipGuard-native `motionQualityGates` so frequency, purpose, keyboard, Reduce Motion, AI-slop, and performance checks are product report data, not a copied skill artifact.

The next external-source eval loop showed the CLI reports were structurally green, but deterministic routing still had no `external-source-audit` mode: a request to integrate Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Design Motion Principles, and X posts routed to `preview-devspace` and missed external-audit, replacement-ledger, capability-matrix, and validation-command proof. `ios eval` now includes an `external-source-native-adoption` fixture and routes those requests through `external-source-audit`.

The next fixture-candidate loop showed the report-quality artifact could name safe public fixture candidates but still left materialization as manual work. `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates <dir>` now writes synthetic public starter directories with redacted candidate metadata, a minimal source report JSON/Markdown pair, validation notes, and no local paths or private app details.

The next materialized-fixture loop showed a promoted synthetic fixture could pass report-quality but still emit a new `fixtureCandidates` entry for itself, creating a recursive "fixture of a fixture" loop. Report-quality now marks already-materialized synthetic fixture reports as actionability evidence while suppressing recursive fixture candidates, and `fixtures/ios-report-quality/materialized-external-audit` locks that behavior into a public fixture.

The next promotion-workflow loop showed generated materialized fixtures were safe and recursive-fixture-proof, but still left the repo promotion step implicit. `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates` now emits `fixture-promotion-manifest.json`, `PROMOTION.md`, and per-candidate promotion metadata with repo-relative suggested paths, placeholder copy commands, validation commands, and a private-data review checklist without auto-copying candidates into the repository.

The next promotion-manifest consumption loop scored the full materialized fixture root and exposed a second-order gap: `fixture-promotion-manifest.json` was being graded as a report-quality source report, creating false `self-report-skipped` and Markdown companion findings. Report-quality now excludes promotion manifests from source-report discovery, consumes them as fixture metadata, renders a `Fixture Promotion Manifests` section, and flags unsafe paths, local/token-like metadata, missing copy placeholders, missing validation commands, incomplete review checklists, stale guide paths, or missing materialized files.

The next read-only Ringly/Ilmify report-quality pass still left a manual gap: it asked which private observation should become a public fixture, but did not produce a safe fixture recipe. `ios report-quality` now emits `fixtureCandidates` with fixture type, synthetic public fixture path, source question, validation commands, and a private-data policy. The goal is to turn private-app evidence into public ShipGuard fixtures without copying private app code, screenshots, local paths, identifiers, or proprietary text.

The next read-only full-report pass showed report-quality could score all source reports as structurally valid while leaving 21 actionability questions unranked and even suggesting "fix high report-quality issues" when there were no findings. `ios report-quality` now emits `priorityAction` and `prioritizedActionabilityQuestions`, ranks report-quality findings before questions, and ranks questions from blocked/review source reports before lower-risk output so the next ShipGuard improvement is concrete.

The installed Codex cache now has `ios-shipguard` metadata version `0.2.2+codex.20260617222317`, repository `https://github.com/jlekerli-source/ShipGuard`, display name `iOS ShipGuard`, and no stale `ringly-codex-workflows`, `Shipguard`, source-path MCP sidecar, or primary `codex-maintainer` guidance. The tracked checkout includes `plugins/ios-shipguard`, and package proof requires that plugin source.

## Verdict

ShipGuard is useful as a CLI and workflow bundle today. It validates itself, produces release proof, checks docs, scores agent runs, exports GitHub Action artifacts, and catches dangerous proof claims in benchmark fixtures.

The Codex plugin source and local cache are now clean enough for local use. The checkout also includes a local marketplace entry under `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; after installing or refreshing that plugin source, Codex still needs a new thread before refreshed skill metadata is loaded.

## Keep

- Keep `shipguard` as the CLI and package command.
- Keep `codex-maintainer` only as a compatibility alias for older automation.
- Keep Agent Autopsy, Arena, docs-check, release-proof, release-consume, release-evidence, transcript verification, CI gate, SARIF, and self-audit.
- Keep the scorecard categories. They map well to real maintainer failure modes.
- Keep the current GitHub Actions coverage because it proves the CLI and release artifacts from source.

## Refine

- Keep Codex plugin source first-class and tracked under `plugins/ios-shipguard`.
- Keep plugin metadata on `ShipGuard` casing and repository/homepage URLs on `jlekerli-source/ShipGuard`.
- Keep installed skill guidance on the restored `shipguard ios` helper surface.
- Keep the marketplace-backed reinstall flow documented so direct cache sync is not the only path.
- Keep real-app read-only checks in the refinement loop with `--shipguard-eval` so ShipGuard reports are judged against Ringly and Ilmify usefulness without turning findings into app work.
- Keep scan-scope reporting visible in iOS reports so private-app QA can explain what was intentionally skipped.
- Add regression-awareness benchmark cases because the Arena average is held down partly by weak regression detection.
- Tighten docs around when to use the CLI versus when to install the Codex plugin.

## Add

- `shipguard codex status` for local Codex install-state proof.
- A marketplace source entry for `ios-shipguard`.
- A plugin install or refresh handoff that says exactly when Codex must be restarted or cache-cleared.
- Keep the restored `shipguard ios` helper commands covered by tests, docs, package proof, and plugin guidance.
- `shipguard ios build-apps` as the native ShipGuard front door for Build iOS Apps build/run/debug/preview/profiler workflows without vendoring the plugin or faking MCP execution from the CLI.
- `shipguard ios performance` as a read-only source scanner for ranked SwiftUI/runtime performance hotspots before Codex chooses edits.
- `--shipguard-eval` as the explicit ShipGuard-only product QA mode for private real-app samples across `ios performance`, `ios design`, `ios modernize`, `ios app-intelligence`, and `ios ai-readiness`.
- `shipguard ios design` for genre-aware UI/UX coherence, design DNA, motion, haptics, preview routing, and ImageGen app-icon handoff.
- `shipguard ios report-quality` to score ShipGuard's own read-only reports for boundaries, evidence, proof guidance, scan scope, Markdown usefulness, token/path shareability, and redaction handoff before turning observations into public fixtures or eval cases.
- `shipguard ios devspace-check` to score Devspace connector readiness, public URL safety, MCP widget metadata, preview evidence, handoff execution boundaries, handoff fixture quality, and ChatGPT model-choice honesty before tunneled visual planning is treated as useful.
- `shipguard ios spec-workflow` to convert report-quality actionability questions into ShipGuard-owned constitution, spec, requirements checklist, native integration decisions, implementation plan, tasks, consistency analysis, analysis gates, slash plan/goal, and Devspace guardrails before Codex implementation.
- `shipguard ios external-audit` to convert Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Design Motion Principles, native iOS workflow skills, X posts, and other external ideas into a native replacement ledger before ShipGuard claims adoption.
- Shared iOS scan-scope exclusions for generated/proof/cache directories, plus tests that generated artifacts do not become report findings.
- A repository threat model artifact before running a full Codex Security scan.
- More Arena fixtures for security-sensitive workflows: credentials, untrusted paths, generated artifacts, network posting, GitHub token scope, and release asset trust.
- Optional OpenAI Agents SDK evaluation only if ShipGuard becomes a runnable agent service. Do not add OpenAI API dependencies to the CLI without that product decision.
- Keep the open-source operating model first-class: contribution flow, support routing, governance, code of conduct, issue templates, package proof, and public docs should stay ShipGuard-native rather than copied from another project.

## Remove Or Defer

- Keep stale public references to `ringly-codex-workflows` out of plugin source and future packages.
- Keep legacy wrapper details out of primary README and CLI flow; route them to `docs/compatibility.md` while package tests prove older automation still works.
- Defer npm or Homebrew distribution until the Codex plugin source and release install story are reliable.
- Defer a full Codex Security repository scan until subagent authorization is explicit; use threat modeling first.
- Defer Agents SDK work until there is a clear agent product, input contract, and eval target.

## Plugin And Skill Guidance

- Superpowers: useful for larger feature design and execution plans. Use it when adding a new subsystem, but keep small CLI/doc fixes on the repo-native proof loop.
- Codex Security: use `threat-model` first. Use full `security-scan` only with explicit subagent authorization and when the scan can produce ledger artifacts.
- OpenAI Developers: use Agents SDK only for a deliberate agent/eval app. Not needed for the current shell CLI or docs-only workflow bundle.
- GitHub: keep using local `gh` and Actions verification for publish proof.

## Phased Plan

### Phase 1: Plugin Source And Local Cache

Status: done.

- Restore tracked `plugins/ios-shipguard` source.
- Update plugin metadata and skill text to `ShipGuard`.
- Include plugin source in package, validate, self-audit, and package tests.
- Refresh the installed local Codex cache.
- Prove with `./bin/shipguard codex status --strict`.

### Phase 2: iOS Helper Decision

Status: done.

- Restored the public `shipguard ios ...` helper commands from the last package as the chosen direction.
- Restored the Python helper scripts, demo iOS fixture, eval cases, docs, and tests as one validated slice.
- Normalized the restored surface to `shipguard` and `ShipGuard` naming while keeping `bin/codex-maintainer` as a compatibility wrapper.

### Phase 3: Marketplace-Backed Install

Status: done locally.

- Added `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` with marketplace id `shipguard` and plugin id `ios-shipguard`.
- Documented the local install flow: `codex plugin marketplace add .`, then `codex plugin add ios-shipguard@shipguard`.
- Documented the new-thread boundary required for Codex to load refreshed skill metadata.
- Added the same Git/source, plugin-cache, and new-thread refresh handoff directly to `shipguard codex status`.
- Remaining distribution work is a real external marketplace/release install path beyond the local checkout.

### Phase 4: Security Evaluation

Status: started.

- Added `docs/security-threat-model.md` before any full scan.
- Added `fixtures/arena/security-token-leakage` for token, local path, and overclaim failure pressure.
- Added an Autopsy `sensitive_data_leak` finding for unredacted local paths, secret-looking tokens, bearer values, and secret assignments without echoing the sensitive value into reports.
- Added `fixtures/arena/release-asset-trust-bypass` and an Autopsy `release_artifact_trust_gap` finding for disabled or bypassed release artifact digest, manifest, attestation, or replay verification.
- Added `fixtures/arena/github-posting-without-dry-run` plus Autopsy findings for broad GitHub token scopes and mutating network calls enabled without dry-run or payload-review safeguards.
- Added `fixtures/arena/generated-artifact-cleanup-bypass` plus an Autopsy `unsafe_artifact_cleanup` finding for generated artifact deletion that bypasses the safe artifact path guard.
- Hardened `shipguard arena import` against unsupported files, nested entries, symlinked fixture files, overlapping source/output paths, and raw local source-path leakage in `PACK.md`.
- Only run the full Codex Security repository scan with explicit subagent authorization.

### Phase 5: Benchmark And Product Polish

Status: started.

- Added `fixtures/arena/storekit-entitlement-regression` to exercise regression-awareness and proof honesty around subscription restore behavior.
- Added `fixtures/arena/data-migration-loss-regression` plus an Autopsy `destructive_migration_risk` finding for migrations that drop persistent user data without backup, rollback, or rehearsal proof.
- Added `shipguard ios performance` after real-app read-only checks showed the previous `performance-audit` route produced proof guidance but not enough concrete source findings.
- Added `shipguard ios build-apps` after integration review showed Build iOS Apps should be reachable through a native ShipGuard command that records topology, workflow routing, proof boundaries, and report-quality questions before Codex executes simulator or profiler tools.
- Added `--shipguard-eval` so private Ringly/Ilmify-style checks are explicitly ShipGuard-only QA, not target-app remediation work.
- Changed the performance report shape to include rule summaries, capped repeated rules in Markdown, exact evidence snippets, and full JSON findings for deeper follow-up.
- Added grouped performance `firstExperiment` output after report-quality kept prioritizing whether grouped actions named the smallest reversible proof step before broad refactors.
- Added grouped performance `validationRoute` and `stopCondition` output after public fixture, Ringly, and Ilmify read-only passes showed first experiments still needed explicit proof routes and stop gates before broader work.
- Extended `--shipguard-eval` to design, modernization, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness reports after read-only Ringly/Ilmify evidence showed the product-QA boundary was needed beyond performance.
- Added `shipguard ios design` so real-app design findings become ShipGuard report-quality evidence, public fixtures, and eval cases instead of private app remediation tasks.
- Added shared iOS scan-scope exclusions and design app-type signal weighting after read-only Ringly/Ilmify evidence showed generated artifacts and repeated instruction docs could distort report quality.
- Added `shipguard ios report-quality` so Ringly/Ilmify-style read-only reports can be graded as ShipGuard product QA before any finding becomes a ShipGuard rule, doc, or fixture.
- Added `shipguard ios devspace-check` after connector/plugin trials showed Devspace needed a first-class readiness report instead of relying on scattered docs and live MCP tests.
- Added a public `fixtures/ios-devspace/complete-preview` handoff so Devspace-check can test event receipts and target-resolution quality without private app code.
- Added `ios devspace-check --shareable` after report-quality showed otherwise-clean Devspace-check reports still needed local-path redaction before external sharing.
- Added `ios design --shareable` after the same shareability issue showed up in design/product-QA reports with local app and preview paths.
- Added `ios report-quality --shareable` after read-only Ringly/Ilmify design evals showed the quality artifact itself could carry local input/report paths even when the source reports were already shareable.
- Added a public report-quality actionability fixture and aggregated `Actionability Questions` output after full Ringly/Ilmify read-only evals showed useful source questions were not surfaced in the quality artifact.
- Added `ios performance --shareable` after read-only Ringly/Ilmify performance evals showed otherwise useful source reports still carried local project roots before report-quality scoring.
- Added `ios modernize --shareable`, `ios app-intelligence --shareable`, and `ios ai-readiness --shareable` after read-only Ringly/Ilmify checks showed those path-safe reports still lacked an explicit shareability contract.
- Added declared-shareability report-quality findings after read-only Ringly/Ilmify local-mode reports showed shareable scoring could pass reports that were path-clean but not explicitly generated for sharing.
- Added `shipguard ios spec-workflow` after clean read-only report-quality runs showed the missing step was converting actionability questions into proof-gated ShipGuard specs, tasks, slash plans, and Devspace guardrails.
- Added spec-workflow adoption quality findings after a misuse probe showed report-quality needed to distinguish report-grounded spec workflows from standalone polished plans.
- Added modernization rule summaries and capped Markdown for modernize, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness reports so private-app findings stay useful for improving ShipGuard without becoming app remediation tasks.
- Improved first-run adoption docs around CLI versus plugin usage.
- Upgraded `shipguard next-goal` so the next improvement loop emits a reviewable `/plan` before the `/goal`, and can now carry bounded scope, completion evidence, and the following `/goal` handoff.
- Moved legacy command-wrapper guidance out of primary README and CLI flow into `docs/compatibility.md`.
- Keep Agents SDK deferred unless ShipGuard becomes a runnable agent service with a concrete eval target.
