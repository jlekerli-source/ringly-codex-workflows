# ShipGuard Evaluation

Generated: 2026-06-17

This is the current usefulness and refinement evaluation for ShipGuard after the rename and README repositioning work.

## Current Real Stable Publication Blocked-State QA

The latest read-only real-release QA run used the public `v3.131.0` ShipGuard release assets as the target evidence. It found a useful ShipGuard product weakness without editing any target app:

- Public release metadata and downloaded release assets passed consumer verification.
- Fresh install and rollback proof passed for the current `shipguard-v3.131.0.tar.gz` package.
- Same-prefix upgrade proof blocked because the previous `v3.130.0` tarball contains generated AppleDouble metadata.
- Stable publication correctly remained blocked because release notes do not describe stable-v4 publication proof and independent adoption/security evidence is not supplied.

The weakness was report UX: the detailed upgrade receipt said blocked, but the top `Readiness Proof` summary still said `Upgrade: pass` because it was reporting route availability instead of supplied proof status. This slice fixes that:

- `v4 release-candidate` readiness summary rows now prefer actual supplied receipt status for fresh install, upgrade, rollback, and release-consume proof.
- Blocked same-prefix upgrade proof now points to `./scripts/package_release.sh && ./tests/package_release_test.sh && ./tests/v4_release_candidate_test.sh` instead of only the focused test.
- Focused tests now assert that blocked supplied upgrade and release-asset proof cannot appear as passing readiness summary rows.

This preserves the honest boundary: real stable v4 remains unclaimed until the public release notes, LaunchKey candidate packet, release assets, independent adoption evidence, and final security review all pass.

## Current Stable Publication Evidence Starter Kit

The latest read-only stable-publication QA run showed a practical usability gap: ShipGuard could identify the missing stable-v4 evidence packet, but a maintainer still had to assemble the fillable evidence files by hand.

This slice improves the execution path without weakening the gate:

- `shipguard v4 stable-publication` now writes `stable-publication-evidence-kit/` into every report directory.
- The kit contains `README.md`, `stable-publication-checklist.json`, `external-adoption-evidence.json`, and `security-review-evidence.json`.
- The JSON report exposes the same artifact as `stablePublicationEvidenceStarterKit`, and Markdown renders an `Evidence Starter Kit` section.
- `ios report-quality`, focused stable-publication tests, and package proof now fail if the starter-kit manifest or generated files disappear.

The starter kit is still draft-only. It helps collect real independent adoption and final security-review evidence; it does not turn fixture evidence or placeholders into stable-v4 proof.

## Current Stable Release Notes Proof Gate

The next stable-publication QA pass showed that the release-notes gate was too easy to satisfy: a short phrase like "stable v4 release proof is ready" could pass the old keyword check even when the public notes did not explain downloaded release assets, post-release consumer proof, independent adoption, final security review, or non-claim boundaries.

This slice makes the gate evidence-shaped:

- `shipguard v4 stable-publication` now analyzes the full GitHub release body, not only the preview stored for human reading.
- `releaseNotesProof` emits a notes digest, line count, seven-topic matrix, and exact `missingTopicIds`.
- Markdown renders a `Release Notes Proof` section so the maintainer can fix the release page directly.
- Focused tests prove weak notes block stable publication even when the candidate packet, release assets, adoption evidence, and security review all pass.

The stable-v4 claim remains blocked until the public release notes describe the real stable-publication proof packet.

## Current Release Notes Authoring Kit

The next read-only QA loop showed a follow-on usability gap: after the stricter release-notes proof gate identified missing topics, ShipGuard still left the maintainer to write the public release body manually.

This slice makes the blocked gate actionable:

- `shipguard v4 stable-publication` now writes `stable-publication-release-notes/` into every report directory.
- The kit contains `README.md`, `release-notes-checklist.json`, and `draft-release-notes.md`.
- The JSON report exposes `stablePublicationReleaseNotesAuthoringKit`, and Markdown renders a `Release Notes Authoring Kit` section.
- The checklist mirrors `releaseNotesProof.missingTopicIds`, so the draft answers the actual blocked topics instead of a generic template.
- `ios report-quality`, focused stable-publication tests, and package proof now fail if the release-notes authoring kit disappears.

The kit is draft-only. It helps edit the public GitHub release notes, then the maintainer must rerun stable-publication against the actual release metadata.

## Current Stable Publication Report Quality Fixtures

The next report-quality pass showed that the stable-publication report shape was now useful, but the public fixture coverage did not recognize the stable-publication proof and release-notes authoring questions as promoted. That meant ShipGuard kept generating duplicate fixture candidates even after the behavior existed.

This slice turns the stable-publication surface into reusable public QA:

- `fixtures/ios-report-quality/stable-publication-complete` now contains a synthetic complete stable-publication report with evidence packet, evidence templates, evidence starter kit, release-notes proof, and release-notes authoring kit.
- `fixtures/ios-report-quality/stable-publication-release-notes-authoring` marks the release-notes authoring question as separately covered.
- `./tests/ios_report_quality_test.sh` now runs the complete fixture and asserts report-quality returns `pass`, detects both fixture coverage entries, and emits no duplicate fixture candidates.

This keeps the next loop moving to new product gaps instead of repeatedly rediscovering the stable-publication authoring work.

## Current Stable Publication Value-Gauntlet Fixture

The next ShipGuard-only read-only QA pass used `shipguard value-gauntlet` and then graded that report with `shipguard ios report-quality`. The gauntlet correctly passed the fixture-backed proof families and identified the remaining real-world gap: stable-v4 publication still needs public GitHub release assets, independent adoption evidence, final security-review evidence, release notes, and post-release consumer proof.

The report-quality weakness was loop hygiene. That stable-v4 publication question is now a known external/publication gate, but it still appeared as a new fixture candidate. This slice promotes the question into a public synthetic fixture:

- `fixtures/ios-report-quality/stable-publication-value-gauntlet-question` records the value-gauntlet stable-publication question without private app data.
- `ios report-quality` now reports it as existing fixture coverage and emits no duplicate `fixtureCandidates` for that question.
- The priority action advances to the next uncovered product-release stabilization question while the ranked list still shows the covered stable-publication question with existing fixture metadata.
- Focused report-quality and package tests prove the fixture ships and keeps the ShipGuard-only/read-only boundary explicit.

This keeps the loop honest: ShipGuard does not fake real stable-v4 publication evidence, but it also does not waste the next refinement cycle rediscovering the same external evidence gate as a missing public fixture.

## Current Product Release Stabilization Value-Gauntlet Fixture

The next read-only ShipGuard QA pass advanced to the product-release stabilization question: whether ShipGuard should stabilize the v4 product release with external adoption evidence, final security review, rollback proof, package proof, and release proof consumption. The useful defect was in ShipGuard itself: `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates` did not treat release/adoption/security/rollback/consumption proof questions as promotion-ready release-proof fixtures.

This slice improves the loop:

- `ios report-quality` now classifies product-release, stable-v4, release-proof, release-consumption, rollback-proof, external-adoption, and security-review questions as `shipguard-release-proof-quality-fixture` candidates.
- `fixtures/ios-report-quality/product-release-stabilization-value-gauntlet-question` promotes the product-release stabilization value-gauntlet question into public synthetic coverage.
- Focused tests prove the promoted fixture scores as `review-existing-fixture`, emits no recursive `fixtureCandidates`, and lets fresh value-gauntlet report-quality runs advance to the next uncovered proof-boundary question.
- Package proof now checks that the new fixture ships in release tarballs.

This is still ShipGuard-only product QA. It does not claim stable v4 is released, does not edit private apps, and does not treat synthetic fixture evidence as external adoption or security evidence.

## Current Surface Proof-Boundary Value-Gauntlet Fixture

The next read-only ShipGuard QA pass advanced to the proof-boundary question: whether every useful-looking surface has docs, tests, package proof, and a concrete proof boundary instead of only a branded name. The weakness was again in ShipGuard's loop mechanics: the question was prioritized, but `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates` produced no materialized candidate for this proof-boundary class.

This slice makes that gap reusable:

- `ios report-quality` now classifies proof-boundary, branded-name, and useful-surface questions as `shipguard-surface-proof-boundary-fixture` candidates.
- `fixtures/ios-report-quality/surface-proof-boundary-value-gauntlet-question` promotes the value-gauntlet proof-boundary question into public synthetic coverage.
- Focused tests prove the promoted fixture scores as `review-existing-fixture`, emits no recursive `fixtureCandidates`, and lets fresh value-gauntlet report-quality runs advance to the next uncovered plugin-skill routing question.
- Package proof now checks that the new fixture ships in release tarballs.

This keeps ShipGuard's funny/vibey naming work honest: names are allowed only when the docs, tests, package proof, and proof boundary are also visible.

## Current Development Loop Efficiency Receipt

The latest self-QA pass showed a real development-process weakness: after the design observation question was promoted into a public fixture, the existing workflow-chain receipt became too coupled to that now-covered design question. The receipt failed even though the product behavior was improving, which meant the proof loop could waste maintainer time on manual interpretation.

This slice fixes the ShipGuard development loop:

- `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/workflow-chain-receipts/report-quality-to-spec-and-next-goal` now uses its own synthetic uncovered report-quality question instead of depending on whichever design question happens to be uncovered that day.
- The receipt proves the intended chain directly: report-quality priority question -> `ios spec-workflow` -> SpecForge tasks and validation commands -> slash plan/goal -> `next-goal`.
- `shipguard value-gauntlet` now reports the workflow-chain receipt as passing again, so the next weak surface moves forward to stable-v4 publication proof instead of getting stuck on stale fixture coupling.

## Current Stable Publication Evidence Templates

The latest stable-publication product-QA pass showed the next usability gap: ShipGuard could tell users that independent adoption and final security-review evidence were missing, but users still had to infer the exact record shape from implementation details.

This slice improves the real publication-proof path:

- `templates/stable-publication/external-adoption-evidence.template.json` and `templates/stable-publication/security-review-evidence.template.json` now ship as draft-only public templates.
- `shipguard v4 stable-publication` now emits `stablePublicationEvidenceTemplates`, including template paths, accepted evidence classes, required fields, copy commands, validation commands, and draft-only instructions.
- The adoption and security entries in `stablePublicationEvidencePacket.requiredEvidence` link to their template path and copy command, and Markdown reports render an `Evidence Templates` section.
- `ios report-quality` now flags stable-publication reports that hide the template catalog or omit template links from the evidence packet.

The templates deliberately do not pass unchanged: they default to draft status and require a real redaction review before they can become stable-v4 evidence.

## Current Verify-First Launch Priority

The next product-facing slice should make `shipguard verify` the obvious launch feature. The repo already has the core pieces: `prepare`, `verify`, release proof, GitHub Actions, check-run/review-comment/SARIF adapters, init profiles, badges, package proof, and Codex plugin guidance. The weakness is discoverability and first-run value, not absence of a verdict engine.

Near-term launch work should therefore orbit one clean proof report:

- one short install/quickstart path
- one tiny broken demo repo or fixture where ShipGuard catches weak proof
- one GitHub Action path for PR proof reports
- one README/docs-site story around proof-gated AI maintenance
- one guarded launch-relay draft workflow for Product Hunt, X, Reddit, GitHub, and ShipYard channels, with final public posting still requiring action-time approval

The v3.153 slice begins that by adding a concise `proofReport` to `shipguard verify`, a public `examples/verify-first/` pass/review/blocked demo, `docs/verify-first-quickstart.md`, and a transparent `examples/workflows/verify-pr.yml` starter workflow. This is deliberately centered on the existing verdict engine rather than adding another branded command.

## Current Stable Publication Evidence Packet

The next ShipYard gauntlet pass keeps every fixture-backed receipt green and correctly leaves `runtimeV4StableReleasePublication` as the remaining real-world gap. The useful improvement is not to fake a stable v4 release; it is to make the final gate easier to execute and review.

This slice improves the real publication-proof path:

- `shipguard v4 stable-publication` now emits `stablePublicationEvidencePacket`, a single machine-readable checklist with all seven required real-evidence inputs, stable evidence IDs, pass/missing counts, the first blocking gate, exact next command, proof order, and non-claims.
- The Markdown report renders the same packet as `Evidence Packet`, so a maintainer can review the proof packet without opening JSON.
- `ios report-quality` now flags stable-publication reports that expose gates but hide this packet, keeping the final v4 claim gate action-oriented without pretending fixture receipts prove real adoption or security review.

## Current Design Observation Promotion Fixture

The latest broad read-only ShipGuard product-QA loop against local app checkouts generated 10 shareable reports across performance, design, modernization, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness. Report-quality scored the set 100/100, and the next uncovered ShipGuard-owned question was design-specific: which private-app observation should become a public design fixture or eval case.

This slice fixes ShipGuard's fixture flywheel, not either target app:

- A new public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/design-observation-promotion` fixture covers the repeated design observation-promotion question without copying private app code, paths, screenshots, or identifiers.
- The fixture keeps `scopeBoundary.shipguardOnly` and `targetAppsReadOnly` explicit, includes app-type tailoring, design-coherence boundary, preview guidance, and synthetic education-profile source signals, and proves the promoted question does not recurse into another fixture candidate.
- Fresh read-only product-QA now treats that design question as fixture-covered, so future loops can move to the next uncovered modernize or app-intelligence report-quality gap instead of re-deciding the same design fixture promotion.

## Current Fixture Candidate Naming

The latest broad read-only ShipGuard product-QA loop against local app checkouts generated 10 shareable source reports across performance, design, modernization, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness. Report-quality scored the set 100/100, but the materialized fixture starter directories still exposed a ShipGuard product weakness: repeated boundary-oriented candidates were written as generic duplicate names such as `01-shipguard-eval-boundary-fixture`, even though the report itself already knew the more useful tool/question slug.

This slice fixes the ShipGuard promotion workflow, not either target app:

- `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates` now preserves the generated candidate's descriptive tool/question ID when writing starter directories and promotion metadata.
- Materialized candidates now read like `01-shipguard-ios-design-which-private-app-observation...` or `04-shipguard-ios-app-intelligence-were-candidate-actions...`, making promotion, review, and fixture dedupe easier to follow.
- The focused report-quality regression lane now fails if materialized candidates collapse back to generic fixture-type names.

## Current Design Preview/Devspace Routing Fixture

The latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA loop against local app checkouts showed the next ShipGuard-owned design gap after app-type tailoring and coherence boundaries: `ios design` mentioned the iPhone preview and Devspace bridge, but `ios report-quality` did not yet enforce whether that visual-proof path was obvious, authenticated, and honest about ChatGPT-side model selection.

This slice fixes the ShipGuard report contract and public eval coverage, not either target app:

- `ios report-quality` now checks `shipguard ios design` reports for `previewEvidence`, preview and Devspace recommended commands, bearer-token Devspace guidance, Markdown preview routing, and the statement that model selection happens in ChatGPT rather than inside ShipGuard.
- Generated design fixture candidates now include synthetic `previewEvidence`, a preview `resultUX.nextCommand`, authenticated Devspace guidance, and a Markdown `Preview And Devspace` section.
- A public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/preview-devspace-routing` fixture covers the repeated read-only product-QA question without copying private app code, paths, screenshots, or app identifiers.
- Regenerating the same read-only design report-quality set scored 100/100; fixture coverage now suppresses app-type, coherence-boundary, and preview/Devspace questions, moving the next uncovered priority to deciding which private-app observation should become the next public design fixture or eval case.

## v3.113.0 Design Coherence Boundary Fixtures

The next read-only ShipGuard product-QA loop against local app checkouts showed the expected next ShipGuard-owned design gap: `ios design` reports had app-type tailoring, but report-quality still needed a durable proof that design-system coherence findings remain ShipGuard product QA evidence and do not become target-app redesign tasks.

The v3.113.0 slice fixes the ShipGuard report contract and public eval coverage, not either target app:

- `ios-design.json` now includes `designCoherenceBoundary` with separate source inventory, coherence risks, `separationChecks`, a ShipGuard-owned next action, app-work authorization, proof boundary, and `targetRemediationStatus: not-authorized-from-this-run`.
- `ios-design.md` now renders a `Design Coherence Boundary` section so the same authorization and proof boundary is visible to humans.
- `ios report-quality --shareable` now flags ShipGuard-evaluation design reports that omit the coherence boundary, separation checks, ShipGuard-owned next action, app-work authorization status, proof boundary, or Markdown rendering.
- A public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/design-coherence-boundary` fixture covers the repeated read-only product-QA question without copying private app code, paths, screenshots, or app identifiers.
- Regenerating the same read-only performance and design report set scored 100/100; fixture coverage now suppresses runtime-boundary, grouped-performance, evidence-promotion, design app-type-tailoring, and design-coherence questions, moving the next uncovered priority to preview and Devspace guidance.

Current read-only report-quality result:

```bash

## v3.112.0 Design App-Type Tailoring Fixtures

The next read-only ShipGuard product-QA loop against local app checkouts showed the expected next ShipGuard-owned design gap: `ios design` inferred app type and emitted motion/haptic guidance, but report-quality needed a durable proof that advice was actually tailored to the inferred app category instead of applying one universal design rule.

The v3.112.0 slice fixes the ShipGuard report contract and public eval coverage, not either target app:

- `ios-design.json` now includes `designTailoring` with `tailoredFor`, `guidanceProfile`, `universalDefaultsRejected`, source signals, tailored motion/haptics/visual-density/copy dimensions, and one `nextAction`.
- `nextAction` names owner, manual proof, expected artifact, success condition, and failure meaning so design reports do not stop at a source inventory.
- `ios-design.md` now renders a `Design Tailoring Contract` section so the same app-type proof is visible to humans.
- `ios report-quality --shareable` now flags design reports that omit the tailoring contract, source signals, tailored dimensions, Markdown rendering, or next-action proof fields.
- A public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/design-app-type-tailoring` fixture covers the repeated read-only product-QA question without copying private app code, paths, screenshots, or app identifiers.
- Regenerating the same read-only performance and design report set scored 100/100; fixture coverage now suppresses runtime-boundary, grouped-performance, evidence-promotion, and design app-type-tailoring questions, moving the next uncovered priority to design-system coherence boundary separation.

Current read-only report-quality result:

```bash
./bin/shipguard ios performance --path <app-a-checkout> --out /tmp/shipguard-readonly-app-a-v3112-after/performance --shipguard-eval --shareable

## v3.111.0 Performance Evidence Promotion Fixtures

The next read-only ShipGuard product-QA loop against local app checkouts showed the expected next ShipGuard-owned gap: `ios performance` already separated source heuristics from runtime proof and grouped repeated findings, but the report still needed one machine-readable promotion contract that tells a solo developer exactly what evidence would move a source suspicion into broader work.

The v3.111.0 slice fixes the ShipGuard report contract and public eval coverage, not either target app:

- `ios-performance.json` now includes `evidencePromotion` with `sourceEvidence`, `promotionStatus`, `firstCandidateRule`, `proofRequired`, and one `nextAction`.
- `nextAction` names the owner, manual proof or command, expected artifact, success condition, and failure meaning so a non-pass performance report does not leave the developer interpreting broad advice.
- `ios-performance.md` now renders an `Evidence Promotion Contract` section so the same proof requirement is visible to humans.
- `ios report-quality --shareable` now flags non-pass performance reports that omit the evidence-promotion contract or hide it from Markdown.
- A public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/performance-evidence-promotion` fixture covers the repeated read-only product-QA question without copying private app code, paths, screenshots, or app identifiers.
- Regenerating the same read-only performance and design report set scored 100/100; fixture coverage now suppresses the runtime-boundary, grouped-performance, and evidence-promotion questions, moving the next uncovered priority to design app-type tailoring.

Current read-only report-quality result:

```bash
./bin/shipguard ios performance --path <app-a-checkout> --out /tmp/shipguard-readonly-app-a-v3111-after/performance --shipguard-eval --shareable

## v3.110.0 Grouped Performance Observation Fixtures

The next read-only ShipGuard product-QA loop against local app checkouts showed a ShipGuard-owned fixture gap: `ios performance` already grouped repeated source heuristics into actionable clusters, but materialized report-quality fixture candidates for grouped performance questions were too generic. They preserved the question and boundaries, but did not include a synthetic repeated finding, grouped action plan, proof boundary, or Markdown table that actually exercised the grouped report contract.

The v3.110.0 slice fixes report-quality fixture generation and public eval coverage, not either target app:

- `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates` now materializes `ios-performance-report-quality-fixture` reports with four synthetic `swiftui-repeat-forever-animation` findings, `ruleSummary`, `groupedActionPlan`, `firstExperiment`, `validationRoute`, `stopCondition`, and split local/manual proof guidance.
- Generated fixture Markdown now renders `Grouped Next Actions`, `Top Findings`, and `Proof Boundaries` so report-quality checks the same reader-facing grouped-performance surface that real app reports rely on.
- A public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/grouped-performance-observation` fixture covers the repeated read-only product-QA question without copying private app code, paths, screenshots, or app identifiers.
- Regenerating the same read-only performance and design report set scored 100/100; fixture coverage now suppresses both the runtime-boundary and grouped-performance questions, moving the next uncovered priority to performance evidence promotion.

Current read-only report-quality result:

```bash

## v3.109.0 Performance Runtime Boundary Fixtures

Read-only ShipGuard product-QA against local Ringly and Ilmify checkouts showed a ShipGuard-owned ambiguity: `shipguard ios performance` had strong grouping, proof, and read-only scope language, but the report contract did not explicitly say that source-only performance findings are heuristics rather than measured runtime proof.

The v3.109.0 slice fixes PulseRadar and report-quality itself, not either target app:

- `ios-performance.json` now includes `runtimeEvidenceBoundary` with `evidence: source heuristic`, `confidence: medium`, `runtimeProof: missing`, and `blocking: no`.
- `ios-performance.md` now renders a `Runtime Evidence Boundary` section before findings, making clear that CPU, GPU, memory, energy, hitch, touch-latency, FPS, ProMotion, thermal, and hardware-display claims still need same-route profiling or physical-device proof.
- `ios report-quality --shareable` now flags `shipguard ios performance` reports that omit the runtime-evidence boundary.
- A public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/performance-runtime-boundary` synthetic fixture covers the repeated read-only boundary question without copying private app code, paths, screenshots, or app identifiers.
- Regenerating the same read-only Ringly/Ilmify performance and design report set scored 100/100 with no report-quality findings; fixture coverage suppressed the already-covered boundary question and moved the next uncovered priority to grouped performance observation fixtures.

Current read-only report-quality result:

## v3.108.0 DockCheck Report Contract

Read-only ShipGuard product-QA against local Ringly and Ilmify checkouts showed a ShipGuard-owned weakness: `shipguard ios doctor` produced useful topology facts, but its JSON still used an older report shape. `ios report-quality --shareable` blocked on missing stable metadata, missing structured finding fields, and local absolute project paths in DockCheck output.

The v3.108.0 slice fixes DockCheck itself, not either target app:

- `ios-doctor.json` now includes `schemaVersion`, `generatedAt`, a privacy-safe `<target-repo>` project root, and target metadata.
- Every DockCheck finding now includes `ruleId`, backward-compatible `code`, `evidence`, `recommendation`, and `proofGuidance`.
- The focused doctor test builds a synthetic public package-only fixture and proves the generated doctor report passes `ios report-quality --shareable`.
- Regenerating the same read-only Ringly/Ilmify report set moved report-quality from blocked to pass with an average score of 100/100 and no report-quality findings.

The next report-quality question from that clean run is performance-boundary wording: blocked performance reports must make it unmistakable that target-app remediation is evidence for ShipGuard product QA unless app work is separately authorized.

These private-app runs are not app remediation plans. They are read-only samples used to evaluate whether ShipGuard reports are specific, prioritized, low-noise, and useful enough to turn into public fixtures or eval cases. The Ringly and Ilmify evidence showed ShipGuard needed the eval boundary on more than performance, plus rule summaries and capped Markdown for noisy modernize, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness reports while keeping complete JSON.

A later read-only Ringly/Ilmify pass showed two additional ShipGuard weaknesses: iOS source scanners could spend too much time traversing generated/proof/cache folders in large app checkouts, and `ios design` app-type inference over-weighted repeated instruction-document wording. The scanners now share a skip-scope helper, reports disclose skipped directories, and design app-type scoring prefers Swift/project signals with capped document contributions.

A subsequent read-only Ringly/Ilmify report-quality pass showed `ios design --shipguard-eval` was still useful but not shareable by default because the JSON carried the local app root. `ios design --shareable` now omits local absolute roots and preview directories from report fields before report-quality scoring or external planning, while default local reports keep operator paths.

The LaunchDeck integration pass showed ShipGuard had useful references to XcodeBuildMCP, simulator browser, SwiftUI preview, and profiler workflows, but no single ShipGuard command that made those workflows feel native. `shipguard ios launchdeck` now inspects repo topology, recommends the right LaunchDeck route, emits XcodeBuildMCP build/run, debugger/log, simulator browser, SwiftUI preview hot reload, and performance profiler handoffs, and keeps the execution boundary honest: ShipGuard owns routing and proof reports, while Codex iOS execution tools execute simulator/debugger/profiler routes.

The next LaunchDeck QA pass showed that a good route report still was not enough: ShipGuard could not tell whether Codex actually ran `build_run_sim`, captured a UI snapshot, opened `serve-sim`, hot-reloaded a SwiftUI preview, or preserved an Animation Hitches/Time Profiler receipt. `shipguard ios launchdeck --receipt <file-or-dir>` now grades explicit proof bundles after execution and flags missing lane-specific evidence while keeping the target app read-only.

A follow-up read-only receipt-quality pass showed the next weakness: weak `ios launchdeck` receipt reports generated fixture candidates, but report-quality ranked a generic front-door question first and classified receipt gaps as performance or preview fixture types. Receipt gaps now rank ahead of generic launchdeck questions, and report-quality emits `ios-launchdeck-receipt-quality-fixture` candidates backed by a public synthetic fixture in `fixtures/ios-report-quality/launchdeck-receipts`.

The next LaunchDeck receipt visibility loop showed another gap: `ios report-quality` could pass a structurally useful source report while hiding that the source report itself was still `review` with receipt findings. Report-quality now keeps those layers separate: `findings` remains report-quality defects, while `sourceFindings`, `sourceIssueVisibility`, and Markdown `Source Report Findings` carry reviewed source issues such as missing Harbor Check build/run proof or Trace Radar profiler proof.

The next read-only loop showed the report-quality artifact itself still carried absolute input/report paths even when its source design reports were shareable. `ios report-quality --shareable` now omits local absolute input and report paths from its own JSON, Markdown, findings, and redaction commands before ChatGPT/GitHub/docs/release-evidence sharing.

A follow-up read-only loop over the full Ringly/Ilmify report set showed another report-quality gap: the source reports carried useful `reportQualityQuestions`, but the quality artifact ended with only generic next actions. `ios report-quality` now aggregates those questions into an `Actionability Questions` section so the next ShipGuard rule, fixture, report section, or docs improvement is explicit.

The next performance explanation pass showed the quality loop could keep prioritizing "why does this matter?" even when `ios performance` already emitted an impact column. Report-quality now verifies `ios performance` findings have an `impact` or `whyItMatters` field and that Markdown surfaces the explanation, while the performance product-QA questions move on to grouping, evidence, proof, and fixture usefulness.

The next repeated-performance pass used a public read-only fixture with many high findings from the same rules. It showed that `ruleSummary` existed, but Markdown still repeated the same high rule rows before giving a rule-level action. `ios performance` now emits `groupedActionPlan`, renders `Grouped Next Actions` before capped individual findings, and `ios report-quality` flags repeated performance reports that omit either JSON grouping or visible Markdown grouping.

The following high-evidence pass showed high findings had source snippets and impact text, but no explicit explanation for why severity was `high`. `ios performance` now emits `severityReason` for findings, renders it as `Why severity` in grouped and top-finding Markdown tables, and `ios report-quality` flags high performance findings that omit the JSON reason or hide it from Markdown. The next product-QA priority moved to local-vs-manual proof guidance.

The next proof-boundary pass showed performance findings still used one blended proof sentence. `ios performance` now emits `localProof` and `manualProof`, renders `Codex local proof` and `Manual/device proof` in Markdown, and `ios report-quality` flags performance reports that omit those split fields or hide them from Markdown. The next product-QA priority moved to whether grouped actions name the smallest first experiment before broad refactors.

A public read-only full-report pass then showed report-quality still prioritized that first-experiment question because grouped performance actions had only broad `recommendedFirstMove` text. `ios performance` now emits a `firstExperiment` for each grouped action, Markdown renders a `First experiment` column before broader first-move advice, and `ios report-quality` emits `performance-grouped-first-experiment-missing` or `performance-markdown-first-experiment-missing` when grouped actions hide the smallest reversible proof step.

The next public fixture plus read-only Ringly/Ilmify performance pass showed the same remaining report-quality weakness: first experiments were present, but the grouped action did not make the validation route and stop condition explicit as report data. `ios performance` now emits `validationRoute` and `stopCondition` for each grouped action, Markdown renders those columns, and `ios report-quality` emits grouped or Markdown findings when validation routes or stop conditions are missing.

A real plugin run from an app checkout showed the iOS skill tried the app-local `./bin/shipguard` path and then fell back to source inspection because the Codex plugin bundle does not install the CLI into every target repo. The skill now resolves `SHIPGUARD_CLI` from app-local `./bin/shipguard`, installed `shipguard`, or `$HOME/.local/bin/shipguard`, and the docs clarify that plugin install loads skill metadata while CLI install provides the executable.

The next read-only performance pass showed `ios performance --shipguard-eval` still carried absolute local project roots, so report-quality correctly raised a local-path shareability warning. `ios performance --shareable` now omits local absolute project paths from JSON and Markdown before report-quality scoring or external planning, while default local reports keep operator paths.

The next remaining-shareability pass over modernize, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness showed no local path leaks in real-app reports, but those reports had no explicit shareability contract. `ios modernize --shareable`, `ios app-intelligence --shareable`, and `ios ai-readiness --shareable` now record shareability metadata and Markdown mode lines so report-quality passes are intentional rather than accidental.

The next declared-shareability pass showed `ios report-quality --shareable` still passed local-mode source reports when their contents happened not to leak paths. Report-quality now emits `declared-shareability-missing` for source reports without shareability metadata and `declared-shareability-local-mode` for reports that explicitly declare local mode, while regenerated shareable Ringly/Ilmify reports continue to pass.

The next read-only Ringly/Ilmify LaunchDeck, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness pass exposed the remaining unbounded source-read paths. `ios launchdeck` now budgets SwiftUI preview-signal reads, `ios app-intelligence` budgets App Intents/system-surface reads, and `ios ai-readiness` budgets AI source-token reads. Each report emits sampled, omitted, and timed-out text evidence in JSON/Markdown, and LaunchDeck shareable ShipGuard-eval output now redacts private target identifiers before report-quality scoring.

The next read-only ShipGuard self-QA pass scored v4 release-candidate, MarketplaceDeck, Full Audit plan-only, and Value Gauntlet reports together. It exposed a report-quality false block: full-audit `stage-receipts/*.json` are internal machine receipts, but recursive directory scoring treated them as standalone reports, and newer root reports such as `shipguard full-audit` and `shipguard codex marketplace-readiness` were missing from the known-tool list. Report-quality now skips full-audit stage receipts during directory scans and treats Full Audit, InspectDeck, MarketplaceDeck, and trace reports as first-class root report tools.

The next LaunchKey self-QA pass showed the same class of false block after fresh package proof landed: `shipguard v4 release-candidate --package-tarball` can write a default `fresh-install-prefix` under the report output, and report-quality recursively scored the installed ShipGuard package as if it were part of the candidate report. Report-quality now skips LaunchKey's generated `fresh-install-prefix`, `fresh-install-work`, and `release-consume` proof directories so the root readiness report remains the scored artifact while the attached receipts stay visible through LaunchKey fields.

The next LaunchKey self-QA pass showed the readiness report still asked whether a fresh user could install, upgrade, uninstall, and validate ShipGuard even after fresh-install proof existed, because upgrade and rollback remained static command guidance. `shipguard v4 release-candidate` now accepts `--upgrade-from-tarball`, installs a previous package, installs the candidate package over the same prefix, verifies the upgraded `shipguard` and `codex-maintainer` versions, runs validation, and records `upgradePackageProof`. When `--package-tarball` is supplied it also installs into a temporary rollback prefix, removes known ShipGuard package paths, verifies no package state remains, and records `rollbackPackageProof`. The same self-QA exposed the matching report-quality boundary: generated `upgrade-prefix`, `upgrade-work`, `rollback-prefix`, and `rollback-work` directories are now skipped as proof attachments, not source reports. Once package install, upgrade, and rollback receipts pass, LaunchKey advances its report-quality question to downloaded release-asset verification instead of repeating the package-proof question.

The next public-release self-QA pass downloaded the published `v3.131.0` assets and showed a sharper package-proof issue: release-consume verification passed, but the package tarball contained AppleDouble `._*` archive members that made installed validation fail. LaunchKey now blocks generated archive members before install, including `._*`, `.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX`, bytecode, and cache paths, and exposes `blockingProof` when any supplied fresh-install, upgrade, rollback, or release-asset receipt fails. The result UX now names the exact blocked receipt, short failure evidence, and next repair command instead of falling back to a generic `./tests/v4_release_candidate_test.sh` instruction.

The next LaunchKey self-QA pass isolated a workflow gap: once package fresh-install, upgrade, and rollback receipts passed, the report still required a separately downloaded release-asset directory. `shipguard v4 release-candidate --download-release-assets --github-release-repo <owner/repo>` now downloads release assets from GitHub, records `githubReleaseAssetDownloadProof`, feeds the downloaded directory into `release-consume verify`, and keeps the manual `--release-assets` path as an offline/pre-downloaded fallback. The live public-release run then exposed the matching report-quality boundary: generated `downloaded-release-assets` directories must be skipped as proof attachments, not recursively scored as source reports.

The next LaunchKey self-QA pass ran package fresh-install, same-prefix upgrade, rollback cleanup, native GitHub release-asset download, and consumer proof together. All machine receipts passed, but the result still ended with prose about finishing external adoption evidence. `shipguard v4 release-candidate --external-adoption-evidence <json-or-dir>` now validates independent adoption evidence records, separates synthetic fixture evidence from stable-v4 eligible evidence, redacts evidence paths in shareable output, and blocks records with private paths, private app identifiers, token-like strings, missing non-claims, or maintainer-only actors. When real adoption evidence is missing, the report now gives a concrete next command instead of a vague stable-v4 checklist.

The next isolated LaunchKey self-QA pass supplied passing package fresh-install, same-prefix upgrade, rollback cleanup, release-asset, and external-adoption evidence. That moved the report to the final security-review gap, but the next action was still a generic test rerun. `shipguard v4 release-candidate --security-review-evidence <json-or-dir>` now validates redacted security review records, requires CLI/plugin/GitHub Actions/release-proof/package-install/redaction-privacy scope coverage, separates synthetic fixture evidence from stable-v4 eligible review evidence, blocks private paths, private app identifiers, token-like strings, missing methodology/artifacts/non-claims, and rejects open critical/high findings. When final security evidence is missing, the report now gives a concrete security-evidence command before any stable-v4 claim.

The next release-packet self-QA pass ran Full Audit in read-only plan mode after LaunchKey could reach the final packet handoff. It exposed an honesty gap: `shipguard full-audit --plan-only` returned `status: pass` even though every stage was only planned. Full Audit now reports plan-only output as `review`, keeps planned stage receipts visible, and sets `resultUX.nextCommand` to the executable profile or exact selected stages with missing `--release-url`, `--version`, `--tag`, `--commit`, and `--ci-run-url` placeholders. That keeps route planning useful without letting planned proof masquerade as executed release proof.

The follow-up Full Audit self-QA pass exposed a different handoff gap: the report was honest about plan-only state, but `slashPlan` and `slashGoal` still contained an old hardcoded v3.132 release-stabilization placeholder while `NEXT_GOAL.md` had already advanced. Full Audit now reads `NEXT_GOAL.md`, prefers the `Following Slash Plan` and `Following Slash Goal` when a completion receipt exists, records `slashHandoffSource`, and falls back to a refresh instruction only when the file cannot be read. Report-quality now emits `full-audit-slash-handoff-source-missing` or `full-audit-slash-handoff-stale` when a Full Audit report lacks that source proof or carries the old hardcoded handoff.

The next Full Audit self-QA pass showed the JSON already carried structured `stages[].command` arrays, but the human Markdown only listed stage names and purposes. A maintainer could see that 14 release stages were planned but could not audit the exact commands from the report itself. Full Audit now renders a Markdown `Execution Commands` table from `stages[].command`, and report-quality emits `full-audit-execution-commands-markdown-missing` or `full-audit-execution-command-missing` when the copy-ready command ledger is absent or incomplete.

The next mixed self-QA bundle scored Full Audit plan-only, InspectDeck, LaunchKey, and Value Gauntlet together. The structure passed, but report-quality picked the generic Full Audit proof-boundary question because the source report status was `review`, even though Value Gauntlet and LaunchKey both pointed at the real v4 release-proof gap. Report-quality now keeps blocked source reports first, then lets Value Gauntlet lowest-value signals, LaunchKey release-readiness gaps, and result-UX release-stabilization signals outrank generic non-blocked review questions. The priority action now starts with the v4 product-release stabilization question instead of a broad Full Audit checklist prompt.

The next read-only Ringly/Ilmify design and performance pass produced structurally clean report-quality output with useful actionability questions, but ShipGuard still lacked a first-class way to convert those questions into governed implementation work. `ios spec-workflow` now generates ShipGuard-owned constitution, feature spec, implementation plan, tasks, analysis gates, slash plan/goal, and Devspace guardrails from a feature or report-quality artifact so private-app observations become ShipGuard product work instead of app remediation tasks.

A follow-up misuse probe showed a shareable spec workflow generated without `--from-report` still passed report-quality even though it was not grounded in observed ShipGuard output. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-report-context-missing` and `spec-workflow-actionability-missing` for that case, so polished-looking spec artifacts need real report evidence before they pass adoption scoring.

The next spec-workflow completeness probe removed a declared generated file from an otherwise valid bundle. Report-quality now dereferences the spec-workflow artifact manifest and emits `spec-workflow-artifact-file-missing` for incomplete bundles while keeping shareable output free of local absolute paths.

The next content-quality probe replaced valid `tasks.md` and `devspace-guardrails.md` files with placeholder text. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-artifact-content-incomplete` and `spec-workflow-artifact-placeholder-content`, so present-but-useless generated files no longer pass adoption scoring.

The next question-coverage probe replaced the generated clarifying questions with a generic question while leaving the spec bundle structurally valid. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-question-coverage-missing` and `spec-workflow-question-artifact-missing`, so report-grounded spec workflows must preserve the source actionability questions in JSON and Markdown.

The next task-coverage probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could pass even when `taskPlan` and `tasks.md` stayed generic and answered none of the source actionability questions. Spec-workflow now creates `S007+` proof-gated tasks for those questions, and report-quality emits `spec-workflow-task-coverage-missing` or `spec-workflow-task-artifact-missing` if a bundle drops them.

The next acceptance-criteria probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could still pass when `featureSpec.acceptanceCriteria` and `feature-spec.md` stayed generic. Spec-workflow now turns deduplicated report-quality actionability questions into acceptance criteria as well as tasks, and report-quality emits `spec-workflow-acceptance-coverage-missing` or `spec-workflow-acceptance-artifact-missing` if a bundle drops them.

The next validation-command probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could pass even when `technicalPlan.recommendedValidation` was empty and `implementation-plan.md` only said validation needed maintainer selection. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-validation-coverage-missing` or `spec-workflow-validation-artifact-missing` when the spec workflow drops exact proof commands.

The next analysis-gate probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could pass after `analysisGates` and `implementation-plan.md` were reduced to a generic maintainer-selection placeholder. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-analysis-coverage-missing` or `spec-workflow-analysis-artifact-missing` when the spec workflow drops the required pre-implementation analysis gates.

The next slash-handoff probe showed a report-grounded spec workflow could pass after `slashPlan`, `slashGoal`, and `ios-spec-workflow.md` were reduced to generic "plan later" placeholders. Report-quality now emits `spec-workflow-slash-handoff-incomplete` or `spec-workflow-slash-handoff-artifact-missing` when a spec bundle drops the copy-ready `/plan` and `/goal` next-loop handoff.

The next read-only spec-workflow loop over public demo reports showed repeated actionability questions could consume the first-eight clarifying-question cap and hide a later unique question. Spec-workflow now deduplicates report-quality questions before applying clarifying-question and task caps, and the regression fixture verifies the generated JSON and Markdown pass report-quality.

The next source-integration review showed the external-repo learning was still too shallow: ShipGuard described checklist/analyze-style workflow inspiration, but did not emit a real requirements checklist or consistency analysis artifact. Spec-workflow now creates `requirements-checklist.md` as planning-requirement unit tests and `consistency-analysis.md` as a cross-artifact coverage review, records ShipGuard-owned adaptation notes for Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Xcode Build Optimization Agent Skills, and the OpenAI native iOS preview loop, and report-quality requires those artifacts before adoption passes.

The next read-only Ringly/Ilmify loop passed report-quality structurally but still showed that "fully integrated" external learning needed an explicit replace/extend/keep/defer decision layer. Spec-workflow now emits `integration-decisions.md` and JSON `integrationDecisions`, evaluates each external workflow idea against the current ShipGuard surface, states what it replaces or keeps, and gives validation evidence. Report-quality now requires that decision artifact and checks it preserves the report-quality questions before adoption passes.

The next external-source review showed even that was still too static: Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, and social-post ideas were represented as hardcoded inspiration inside spec-workflow instead of a repeatable source audit. `ios external-audit` now records read-only source checkouts and URLs, classifies source capabilities, emits a native replacement ledger, states what ShipGuard replaces, extends, keeps, routes, or defers, and carries license/no-vendoring boundaries plus report-quality questions. A source is not considered integrated until its capability has a ShipGuard-native action and validation command.

The next design-source pass used the installed Design Motion Principles skill as a read-only input and exposed a classifier weakness: the Expo profile could match `EAS` inside ordinary words such as `easing`. External-audit now uses boundary-aware source signals and has a first-class Design Motion Principles profile; `ios design` emits ShipGuard-native `motionQualityGates` so frequency, purpose, keyboard, Reduce Motion, AI-slop, and performance checks are product report data, not a copied skill artifact.

The next external-source eval loop showed the CLI reports were structurally green, but deterministic routing still had no `external-source-audit` mode: a request to integrate Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Design Motion Principles, and X posts routed to `preview-devspace` and missed external-audit, replacement-ledger, capability-matrix, and validation-command proof. `ios eval` now includes an `external-source-native-adoption` fixture and routes those requests through `external-source-audit`.

The next fixture-candidate loop showed the report-quality artifact could name safe public fixture candidates but still left materialization as manual work. `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates <dir>` now writes synthetic public starter directories with redacted candidate metadata, a minimal source report JSON/Markdown pair, validation notes, and no local paths or private app details.

The next materialized-fixture loop showed a promoted synthetic fixture could pass report-quality but still emit a new `fixtureCandidates` entry for itself, creating a recursive "fixture of a fixture" loop. Report-quality now marks already-materialized synthetic fixture reports as actionability evidence while suppressing recursive fixture candidates, and `fixtures/ios-report-quality/materialized-external-audit` locks that behavior into a public fixture.

The next promotion-workflow loop showed generated materialized fixtures were safe and recursive-fixture-proof, but still left the repo promotion step implicit. `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates` now emits `fixture-promotion-manifest.json`, `PROMOTION.md`, and per-candidate promotion metadata with repo-relative suggested paths, placeholder copy commands, validation commands, and a private-data review checklist without auto-copying candidates into the repository.

The next value-gauntlet loop showed skill/plugin receipt proof was useful but still stopped before the full ShipGuard product workflow: a report-quality question could exist without proof that it became a spec task, validation command, slash plan, and following goal. `shipguard value-gauntlet` now emits `workflowChainReceipts` and runs a public chain over `fixtures/demo-ios-repo`: `ios design --shipguard-eval --shareable`, `ios report-quality --shareable`, `ios spec-workflow --from-report --shipguard-eval --shareable`, spec report-quality, and `next-goal`.

The next promotion-manifest consumption loop scored the full materialized fixture root and exposed a second-order gap: `fixture-promotion-manifest.json` was being graded as a report-quality source report, creating false `self-report-skipped` and Markdown companion findings. Report-quality now excludes promotion manifests from source-report discovery, consumes them as fixture metadata, renders a `Fixture Promotion Manifests` section, and flags unsafe paths, local/token-like metadata, missing copy placeholders, missing validation commands, incomplete review checklists, stale guide paths, or missing materialized files.

The next read-only Ringly/Ilmify report-quality pass still left a manual gap: it asked which private observation should become a public fixture, but did not produce a safe fixture recipe. `ios report-quality` now emits `fixtureCandidates` with fixture type, synthetic public fixture path, source question, validation commands, and a private-data policy. The goal is to turn private-app evidence into public ShipGuard fixtures without copying private app code, screenshots, local paths, identifiers, or proprietary text.

The next read-only full-report pass showed report-quality could score all source reports as structurally valid while leaving 21 actionability questions unranked and even suggesting "fix high report-quality issues" when there were no findings. `ios report-quality` now emits `priorityAction` and `prioritizedActionabilityQuestions`, ranks report-quality findings before questions, and ranks questions from blocked/review source reports before lower-risk output so the next ShipGuard improvement is concrete.

The installed Codex cache should be refreshed to `ios-shipguard` metadata version `0.2.46+codex.20260619125045`, repository `https://github.com/jlekerli-source/ShipGuard`, display name `iOS ShipGuard`, and no stale `ringly-codex-workflows`, `Shipguard`, source-path MCP sidecar, or primary `codex-maintainer` guidance. The tracked checkout includes `plugins/ios-shipguard`, and package proof requires that plugin source.

The next value-gauntlet pass scored the ShipYard at 100.0 but still prioritized whether low-value patterns should become public fixtures. That question is now promoted into `fixtures/ios-report-quality/value-gauntlet-actionability`, a synthetic report-quality fixture that keeps `shipguard value-gauntlet` actionability visible while proving materialized fixtures do not recursively emit more fixture candidates.

The next command-depth probe showed the loop could still waste time by asking for the same value-gauntlet fixture again even after promotion. `ios report-quality` now detects promoted public fixtures under `fixtures/ios-report-quality`, renders `Fixture Coverage`, suppresses duplicate fixtureCandidates for covered questions, and moves the priority action to the next uncovered question.

The next ShipYard value loop showed `shipguard value-gauntlet` needed to answer its own "which surface is weakest?" question instead of handing a human an unranked all-green report. It now emits `lowestValueSurfaceProbe`, upgrades the copied starter skills with ShipGuard QA hooks, verifies starter-skill docs/test linkage, and escalates all-green static coverage into a runtime-output usefulness probe for the next implementation slice.

The runtime-output slice now executes representative ShipGuard commands on public/demo inputs: Brand Deck, DockCheck, VibeCheck, and QualityRadar. `runtimeOutputProbe` scores their generated JSON/Markdown for exit status, artifacts, machine-readable status, required keys, boundary language, Markdown sections, and usefulness signals. This exposed thin machine output in Brand Deck and DockCheck, so those reports now include top-level surface/status summary fields. With representative runtime output passing, the next weakness is negative runtime-output fixtures that fail decorative but low-value reports instead of letting them pass because they look complete.

The negative runtime-output slice now adds public synthetic fixtures under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/runtime-output`. One fixture is report-shaped but empty; another has plausible design content but no ShipGuard-only boundary. `runtimeOutputNegativeFixtures` proves both are rejected while the fixture expectations pass, which unlocked the command help execution slice instead of another static metadata check.

The command-family runtime slice now executes `--help` for all registered public ShipGuard commands through `runtimeCommandFamilyCoverage`. That probe exposed top-level wrapper routes where `--help` was treated as an invalid file, path, or missing subcommand; the wrapper now handles top-level help consistently. With all public command help paths passing, ShipGuard could move beyond command entry points and test skill/plugin runtime receipts.

The skill/plugin receipt slice now adds public fixtures under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/skill-plugin-receipts`. `skillPluginRuntimeReceipts` executes the iOS ShipGuard design-audit route, a starter UI-polish inventory/plan route, and plugin cache status proof against a synthetic Codex plugin cache. The receipts must produce real JSON/Markdown artifacts or stdout proof before the skill/plugin layer passes.

The workflow-chain receipt slice added a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/workflow-chain-receipts`. `workflowChainReceipts` executes design -> report-quality -> spec-workflow -> spec report-quality -> next-goal, and requires the source actionability question, proof-gated task, validation commands, copy-ready slash plan/goal, and following NextRail handoff to survive the chain.

The scenario-matrix receipt slice added a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/scenario-matrix-receipts`. `scenarioMatrixReceipts` executes a complete maintainer loop across iOS doctor, inventory, plan, design, report-quality, docs-check, transcript redaction and verification, CI gate and summary, Codex plugin status, and release manifest/index/replay using public fixtures plus a synthetic release package.

The scenario-failure receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/scenario-failure-receipts`. `scenarioFailureReceipts` feeds unsafe transcript text, broken docs, stale Codex plugin cache metadata, and incomplete release proof into real ShipGuard commands and requires non-zero exits or blocked reports with machine-readable evidence.

The scenario-remediation receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/scenario-remediation-receipts`. `scenarioRemediationReceipts` proves those same blocked journeys recover through the smallest repair step and successful rerun: transcript redact plus verify, missing docs target plus docs-check, fresh Codex plugin cache plus strict status, and complete release manifest/index plus release replay. With that receipt green, the next weakness is adoption receipts that prove a fresh user can install ShipGuard, refresh the Codex plugin, run the first useful audit, and understand the next command without maintainer context.

The fresh-user adoption receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/adoption-receipts`. `adoptionReceipts` copies the current checkout to a temporary package source, runs `scripts/package_release.sh` there, extracts the tarball, installs ShipGuard into a temporary prefix, prepares a fresh synthetic Codex plugin cache, verifies `shipguard codex status --strict`, runs the first Brand Deck audit from the installed CLI, and scores that audit with `ios report-quality --shareable`. With package adoption green, the next weakness is target-onboarding receipts that prove a fresh app repo can install starter files, run doctor/validate, and get the first scoped plan without maintainer context.

The target-onboarding receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/target-onboarding-receipts`. `targetOnboardingReceipts` copies `fixtures/demo-ios-repo` into a temporary fresh target, runs `shipguard init ios`, starter `doctor`, toolkit `validate`, iOS doctor, iOS inventory, and the first permission-audit plan. The receipt proves a fresh iOS app can reach actionable ShipGuard output without maintainer context.

The multi-profile onboarding receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/multi-profile-onboarding-receipts`. `multiProfileOnboardingReceipts` creates fresh iOS, web, backend, and CLI target repos, runs each starter `init` and `doctor`, verifies each target receives `SHIPGUARD_PROFILE.md`, and keeps the whole proof ShipGuard-only.

The profile-native first-audit receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/profile-native-first-audit-receipts`. `profileNativeFirstAuditReceipts` creates fresh web, backend, and CLI starter targets, prepares synthetic framework/API/CLI signals, runs ShipGuard WebScan, ServiceRadar, and CommandLens, checks shareable JSON/Markdown outputs, verifies generated ShipGuard starter files are separated from target evidence, and grades the reports with `ios report-quality`.

The profile-native fix-plan receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/profile-native-fix-plan-receipts`. `profileNativeFixPlanReceipts` creates fresh web, backend, and CLI starter targets, runs the first audits, converts each report through ShipGuard WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge, checks scoped tasks, validation commands, stop conditions, shareable Markdown, and report-quality handoff.

The profile-native validation receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/profile-native-validation-receipts`. `profileNativeValidationReceipts` runs WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge against synthetic target repos with `--target`, then requires `validationReceipts` to classify each validation lane as runnable, blocked, manual, or not checked without executing arbitrary target commands.

The profile-native validation rerun receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/profile-native-validation-rerun-receipts`. `profileNativeValidationRerunReceipts` starts WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge with one blocked synthetic validation lane each, applies the fixture-local smallest repair, reruns the plan, and requires `blockedCount` plus `validationRerunReceipts.pairCount` to clear.

The profile-native proof handoff receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/profile-native-proof-handoff-receipts`. `profileNativeProofHandoffReceipts` runs repaired WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge plans and requires `proofHandoff.copyReady=true`, local-path-safe copy-ready Markdown, validation status, commands to capture, and explicit no-implementation/no-validation-authorization boundaries.

The command-family runtime-output receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/command-family-runtime-output-receipts`. `commandFamilyRuntimeOutputReceipts` runs Brand Deck, DockCheck, VibeCheck, WebScan, WebForge, LinkSweep, and ManifestForge against public or synthetic inputs, then requires useful JSON/Markdown artifacts, local-path-safe shareable reports where applicable, and machine-readable proof that each command produced actionable output beyond `--help`.

The trust-hardening receipt slice adds a public fixture under `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/trust-hardening-receipts`. `trustHardeningReceipts` scans composite action shell bodies for raw `${{ inputs.* }}` interpolation, runs the Devspace public URL token blocker, exercises unsafe archive extraction rejection, and proves release provenance rejects bad or tag-mismatched release URLs while still emitting valid provenance for a synthetic release manifest. With those receipts green, the next weakness was the persistent proof-gated task contract that connects prepare, verify, scope, evidence, and verdict.

The proof-gated task-contract slice adds `shipguard prepare`, `shipguard verify`, `scripts/task_contract.py`, `docs/task-contract.md`, focused task-contract tests, and `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/task-contract-receipts`. `taskContractReceipts` now proves a public iOS task can create one durable task object, use bounded project snapshots, discover generic iOS scope, pass a scoped diff only with structured validation receipt coverage, reject a plain log as proof, block invalid receipts, and block a protected/out-of-scope diff plus unsupported "fully verified" claim with an exact next action. With diff-first receipts green, the next weakness is an iOS notification and permission workflow that turns permission-risk discovery into prepare/verify task contracts, focused validation receipts, and simulator/device proof guidance.

The notification-permission workflow slice uses read-only product-QA evidence as a ShipGuard weakness, not as app work. The observed gap was that `prepare` could correctly classify notification/permission work as risky while still returning a generic task contract. The public fixture now proves `prepare` emits `domainRiskPack.id = ios-notification-permission-workflow`, receipt requirements, simulator/device boundaries, and review-only lifecycle/plist surfaces. A new negative receipt proves `verify` returns `review` when a generic structured test receipt covers the command but lacks permission-state, denied-state, not-determined-state, and simulator permission-reset proof labels.

The Domain Pack SDK slice turns that first pack into a reusable extension point. `scripts/task_domain_packs.py` now exposes `DomainPackRegistry`, `domainPackSDK` metadata, pack result fields, notification-permission compatibility, and a synthetic public fixture pack. `domainPackSDKReceipts` prove a second pack can prepare and verify through the same task-contract verdict engine without activating unrelated notification proof lanes.

The configuration-baseline slice answers the next read-only value-gauntlet weakness. `scripts/shipguard_baseline.py` loads `.shipguard.yml` and `.shipguard-baseline.json`, requires exact finding fingerprints, and keeps accepted findings visible with owner, expiry, and proof-boundary metadata. `configurationBaselineReceipts` prove three public cases: an exact accepted protected-boundary finding can pass, an expired suppression blocks, and a second unsuppressed protected file remains a new regression.

The structured-evidence slice answered the next weakness after baselines. `scripts/shipguard_receipts.py` normalizes current v2 receipts, legacy task-contract receipts, artifact-only files, unsupported schema versions, stale receipts, invalid receipts, and downgraded manual/runtime proof receipts into one `evidenceReceiptSchema` contract. `structuredEvidenceReceipts` prove six public cases: prepare a neutral task, pass with a v2 validation receipt, pass with a legacy-compatible receipt, block an unsupported schema receipt, return review for a manual proof receipt that cannot satisfy automated validation, and block a stale v2 receipt.

The agent-adapter slice answered the next weakness after structured receipts. `scripts/agent_trace.py` adds ShipGuard TraceBridge through `shipguard agent trace` and `shipguard codex trace`: a dependency-light adapter that consumes exported or synthetic Codex-style traces, normalizes evidence receipts, optionally runs `shipguard verify`, attaches the verdict handoff, emits a v2 runtime receipt, and enforces the 2-3 worker / five-worker cap policy. `agentAdapterReceipts` prove four public paths: prepare a task, run a trace with verify and a v2 receipt, block an over-budget trace, and route the Codex alias.

The Expo/EAS assurance slice answered the next weakness after XcodeBuildMCP evidence. `shipguard agent trace --expo-eas-evidence <file-or-dir>` and `shipguard codex trace --expo-eas-evidence <file-or-dir>` attach Expo MCP routing, Expo prebuild, EAS build/update, native runtime logs, artifact-integrity metadata, and credential-boundary proof to the same task timeline and runtime receipt. `expoEASAssuranceReceipts` prove the adapter with public synthetic evidence while keeping Expo/EAS assurance separate from store, TestFlight, physical-device, and production-rollout proof.

The universal-agent packaging slice answers the next weakness after Expo/EAS assurance. `shipguard agent trace --adapter claude|gemini|cursor|mcp|generic` now emits adapter packaging guidance, shared schema metadata, and `universal-agent-packaging-adapter` runtime receipts for non-Codex traces. `universalAgentPackagingReceipts` prove the adapter with public synthetic Claude, Gemini, Cursor, MCP, and auto-detection traces.

The full-audit slice answers the next weakness after universal packaging. `shipguard full-audit` now plans and runs validation, value-gauntlet, report-quality, package proof, install refresh, plugin status, CI proof, and release-proof preparation through resumable stage receipts. `fullAuditOrchestratorReceipts` prove plan-only release coverage, mini execution, and resume reuse on public fixtures. With those receipts green, the next value-gauntlet weakness was the v3.125 unified inspect experience: ShipGuard proof state was split across too many reports and needed one concise inspect surface without hiding underlying evidence.

The unified inspect slice adds `shipguard inspect` and `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/unified-inspect-receipts`. `unifiedInspectReceipts` create synthetic value-gauntlet, full-audit, and release-proof inputs, run InspectDeck, and require one shareable report with repo state, proof inputs, plugin state, release state, underlying evidence, scope boundary, and one exact next action.

The concise result-UX slice adds `scripts/shipguard_result.py` and `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/concise-verdict-result-ux-receipts`. `conciseVerdictResultUXReceipts` run full-audit, iOS design, iOS performance, and InspectDeck on public/synthetic inputs and require each report to lead with `resultUX` plus Markdown `## Result`: verdict, proof source, why it matters, and one next command.

The Codex marketplace-readiness slice adds `scripts/codex_marketplace_readiness.py`, `docs/codex-marketplace-readiness.md`, and `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/codex-marketplace-readiness-receipts`. `codexMarketplaceReadinessReceipts` run the public MarketplaceDeck path and require plugin metadata, local marketplace source, README/profile presentation, icon assets, screenshot policy, strict status proof, privacy/model-choice boundaries, and a copy-ready submission packet.

The External Benchmark v2 slice extends `shipguard pilot-bench` with `--benchmark-v2` and adds `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/external-benchmark-v2-receipts`. `externalBenchmarkV2Receipts` run public-safe comparative traces with `baselineVerdict`, require meaningful ShipGuard score lift, and prove verdict usefulness without private app leakage. With those receipts green, the next value-gauntlet weakness was v4 preview stabilization.

The V4 Release Candidate Readiness slice adds `shipguard v4 release-candidate`, `docs/v4-release-candidate.md`, and `fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/v4-release-candidate-readiness-receipts`. `v4ReleaseCandidateReadinessReceipts` prove the release-candidate report has fresh install, package-tarball fresh-install proof, same-prefix upgrade proof, rollback cleanup proof, release-proof consumption, external adoption evidence proof, final security-review evidence proof, external adoption packet, final schema docs, plugin refresh proof, release-readiness checks, blocked stable-release claims, and shared result UX. `v4ProductReleaseStabilizationReceipts` now extend that proof with a public fixture that builds release proof, derives a previous package, assembles downloaded release assets, runs LaunchKey with package/upgrade/rollback/release-consume/adoption/security evidence, and hands the result to report-quality. With those receipts green, the next value-gauntlet weakness is real stable-v4 publication proof from downloaded GitHub release assets plus independent adoption/security evidence.

A later read-only Ringly/Ilmify product-QA loop exposed a ShipGuard-owned performance problem rather than an app task: large or file-provider-backed source trees could make `ios doctor`, `ios performance`, `ios design`, and `ios modernize` spend too long reading Swift/text files before any useful report appeared. ShipGuard now uses a shared bounded text reader for source heuristics, records `scanScope.textBytesPerFileLimit`, `textReadTimeoutSeconds`, truncated files, omitted large files, and timed-out files in JSON/Markdown, and proves the behavior with `tests/ios_scan_scope_budget_test.sh` using a public synthetic large Swift file. These reports remain useful first-pass evidence, but sampled or omitted files are explicitly disclosed so source coverage is not overstated.

## Verdict

ShipGuard is useful as a CLI and workflow bundle today. It validates itself, produces release proof, checks docs, scores agent runs, exports GitHub Action artifacts, and catches dangerous proof claims in benchmark fixtures.

The Codex plugin source and local cache are now clean enough for local use. The checkout also includes a local marketplace entry under `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; after installing or refreshing that plugin source, Codex still needs a new thread before refreshed skill metadata is loaded.

## Keep

- Keep `shipguard` as the CLI and package command.
- Keep `codex-maintainer` only as a compatibility alias for older automation.
- Keep Agent Autopsy, Arena, docs-check, release-proof, release-consume, release-evidence, transcript verification, CI gate, SARIF, and self-audit.
- Keep the scorecard categories. They map well to real maintainer failure modes.
- Keep the current GitHub Actions coverage because it proves the CLI and release artifacts from source.

## Refine

- Keep Codex plugin source first-class and tracked under `plugins/ios-shipguard`.
- Keep plugin metadata on `ShipGuard` casing and repository/homepage URLs on `jlekerli-source/ShipGuard`.
- Keep installed skill guidance on the restored `shipguard ios` helper surface.
- Keep the marketplace-backed reinstall flow documented so direct cache sync is not the only path.
- Keep real-app read-only checks in the refinement loop with `--shipguard-eval` so ShipGuard reports are judged against Ringly and Ilmify usefulness without turning findings into app work.
- Keep scan-scope reporting visible in iOS reports so private-app QA can explain what was intentionally skipped.
- Add regression-awareness benchmark cases because the Arena average is held down partly by weak regression detection.
- Tighten docs around when to use the CLI versus when to install the Codex plugin.

## Add

- `shipguard codex status` for local Codex install-state proof.
- A marketplace source entry for `ios-shipguard`.
- A plugin install or refresh handoff that says exactly when Codex must be restarted or cache-cleared.
- Keep the restored `shipguard ios` helper commands covered by tests, docs, package proof, and plugin guidance.
- `shipguard ios launchdeck` as the native ShipGuard front door for LaunchDeck build/run/debug/preview/profiler workflows without vendoring the plugin or faking MCP execution from the CLI.
- `shipguard ios performance` as a read-only source scanner for ranked SwiftUI/runtime performance hotspots before Codex chooses edits.
- `--shipguard-eval` as the explicit ShipGuard-only product QA mode for private real-app samples across `ios performance`, `ios design`, `ios modernize`, `ios app-intelligence`, and `ios ai-readiness`.
- `shipguard ios design` for genre-aware UI/UX coherence, design DNA, motion, haptics, preview routing, and ImageGen app-icon handoff.
- `shipguard ios report-quality` to score ShipGuard's own read-only reports for boundaries, evidence, proof guidance, scan scope, Markdown usefulness, token/path shareability, and redaction handoff before turning observations into public fixtures or eval cases.
- `shipguard value-gauntlet` to score every ShipGuard command, skill, plugin, GitHub Action, doc, package proof path, and proof boundary for developer usefulness before a branded surface is treated as mature.
- `shipguard ios devspace-check` to score Devspace connector readiness, public URL safety, MCP widget metadata, preview evidence, handoff execution boundaries, handoff fixture quality, and ChatGPT model-choice honesty before tunneled visual planning is treated as useful.
- `shipguard ios spec-workflow` to convert report-quality actionability questions into ShipGuard-owned constitution, spec, requirements checklist, native integration decisions, implementation plan, tasks, consistency analysis, analysis gates, slash plan/goal, and Devspace guardrails before Codex implementation.
- `shipguard ios external-audit` to convert Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Design Motion Principles, native iOS workflow skills, X posts, and other external ideas into a native replacement ledger before ShipGuard claims adoption.
- Shared iOS scan-scope exclusions for generated/proof/cache directories, plus tests that generated artifacts do not become report findings.
- A repository threat model artifact before running a full Codex Security scan.
- More Arena fixtures for security-sensitive workflows: credentials, untrusted paths, generated artifacts, network posting, GitHub token scope, and release asset trust.
- Optional OpenAI Agents SDK evaluation only if ShipGuard becomes a runnable agent service. Do not add OpenAI API dependencies to the CLI without that product decision.
- Keep the open-source operating model first-class: contribution flow, support routing, governance, code of conduct, issue templates, package proof, and public docs should stay ShipGuard-native rather than copied from another project.

## Remove Or Defer

- Keep stale public references to `ringly-codex-workflows` out of plugin source and future packages.
- Keep legacy wrapper details out of primary README and CLI flow; route them to `docs/compatibility.md` while package tests prove older automation still works.
- Defer npm or Homebrew distribution until the Codex plugin source and release install story are reliable.
- Defer a full Codex Security repository scan until subagent authorization is explicit; use threat modeling first.
- Defer Agents SDK work until there is a clear agent product, input contract, and eval target.

## Plugin And Skill Guidance

- Superpowers: useful for larger feature design and execution plans. Use it when adding a new subsystem, but keep small CLI/doc fixes on the repo-native proof loop.
- Codex Security: use `threat-model` first. Use full `security-scan` only with explicit subagent authorization and when the scan can produce ledger artifacts.
- OpenAI Developers: use Agents SDK only for a deliberate agent/eval app. Not needed for the current shell CLI or docs-only workflow bundle.
- GitHub: keep using local `gh` and Actions verification for publish proof.

## Phased Plan

## Current Plugin Skill Routing Value-Gauntlet Fixture

The next read-only ShipGuard self-QA pass showed `shipguard value-gauntlet` still prioritized this question after the stable-publication, product-release, and surface proof-boundary questions were covered: "Do plugin skills and starter skills give Codex actionable routing and validation commands, not just vague advice?" `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates` now classifies plugin-skill, starter-skill, actionable-routing, and validation-command questions as `shipguard-plugin-skill-routing-fixture` candidates.

The promoted public fixture is `fixtures/ios-report-quality/plugin-skill-routing-value-gauntlet-question`. Focused tests prove the live value-gauntlet report now marks that question as covered, emits no duplicate fixture candidate, and scores the promoted fixture as an existing fixture instead of recursively generating another candidate. The package proof also checks the fixture files ship in release archives.

## Current Stable-Publication Fixture Review

The following read-only self-QA pass moved from uncovered candidate generation to existing-fixture review. Reviewing `fixtures/ios-report-quality/stable-publication-value-gauntlet-question` exposed stale generated metadata inside the promoted fixture: nested candidate ids and suggested paths still referenced the original materialized slug instead of the stable public fixture path. The fixture now uses `stable-publication-value-gauntlet-question` consistently and records the fixture type as `shipguard-release-proof-quality-fixture`; focused tests assert both fields during report-quality scoring.

### Phase 1: Plugin Source And Local Cache

Status: done.

- Restore tracked `plugins/ios-shipguard` source.
- Update plugin metadata and skill text to `ShipGuard`.
- Include plugin source in package, validate, self-audit, and package tests.
- Refresh the installed local Codex cache.
- Prove with `./bin/shipguard codex status --strict`.

### Phase 2: iOS Helper Decision

Status: done.

- Restored the public `shipguard ios ...` helper commands from the last package as the chosen direction.
- Restored the Python helper scripts, demo iOS fixture, eval cases, docs, and tests as one validated slice.
- Normalized the restored surface to `shipguard` and `ShipGuard` naming while keeping `bin/codex-maintainer` as a compatibility wrapper.

### Phase 3: Marketplace-Backed Install

Status: done locally.

- Added `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` with marketplace id `shipguard` and plugin id `ios-shipguard`.
- Documented the local install flow: `codex plugin marketplace add .`, then `codex plugin add ios-shipguard@shipguard`.
- Documented the new-thread boundary required for Codex to load refreshed skill metadata.
- Added the same Git/source, plugin-cache, and new-thread refresh handoff directly to `shipguard codex status`.
- Remaining distribution work is a real external marketplace/release install path beyond the local checkout.

### Phase 4: Security Evaluation

Status: started.

- Added `docs/security-threat-model.md` before any full scan.
- Added `fixtures/arena/security-token-leakage` for token, local path, and overclaim failure pressure.
- Added an Autopsy `sensitive_data_leak` finding for unredacted local paths, secret-looking tokens, bearer values, and secret assignments without echoing the sensitive value into reports.
- Added `fixtures/arena/release-asset-trust-bypass` and an Autopsy `release_artifact_trust_gap` finding for disabled or bypassed release artifact digest, manifest, attestation, or replay verification.
- Added `fixtures/arena/github-posting-without-dry-run` plus Autopsy findings for broad GitHub token scopes and mutating network calls enabled without dry-run or payload-review safeguards.
- Added `fixtures/arena/generated-artifact-cleanup-bypass` plus an Autopsy `unsafe_artifact_cleanup` finding for generated artifact deletion that bypasses the safe artifact path guard.
- Hardened `shipguard arena import` against unsupported files, nested entries, symlinked fixture files, overlapping source/output paths, and raw local source-path leakage in `PACK.md`.
- Only run the full Codex Security repository scan with explicit subagent authorization.

### Phase 5: Benchmark And Product Polish

Status: started.

- Added `fixtures/arena/storekit-entitlement-regression` to exercise regression-awareness and proof honesty around subscription restore behavior.
- Added `fixtures/arena/data-migration-loss-regression` plus an Autopsy `destructive_migration_risk` finding for migrations that drop persistent user data without backup, rollback, or rehearsal proof.
- Added `shipguard ios performance` after real-app read-only checks showed the previous `performance-audit` route produced proof guidance but not enough concrete source findings.
- Added `shipguard ios launchdeck` after integration review showed LaunchDeck should be reachable through a native ShipGuard command that records topology, workflow routing, proof boundaries, and report-quality questions before Codex executes simulator or profiler tools.
- Added `--shipguard-eval` so private Ringly/Ilmify-style checks are explicitly ShipGuard-only QA, not target-app remediation work.
- Changed the performance report shape to include rule summaries, capped repeated rules in Markdown, exact evidence snippets, and full JSON findings for deeper follow-up.
- Added grouped performance `firstExperiment` output after report-quality kept prioritizing whether grouped actions named the smallest reversible proof step before broad refactors.
- Added grouped performance `validationRoute` and `stopCondition` output after public fixture, Ringly, and Ilmify read-only passes showed first experiments still needed explicit proof routes and stop gates before broader work.
- Extended `--shipguard-eval` to design, modernization, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness reports after read-only Ringly/Ilmify evidence showed the product-QA boundary was needed beyond performance.
- Added `shipguard ios design` so real-app design findings become ShipGuard report-quality evidence, public fixtures, and eval cases instead of private app remediation tasks.
- Added shared iOS scan-scope exclusions and design app-type signal weighting after read-only Ringly/Ilmify evidence showed generated artifacts and repeated instruction docs could distort report quality.
- Added `shipguard ios report-quality` so Ringly/Ilmify-style read-only reports can be graded as ShipGuard product QA before any finding becomes a ShipGuard rule, doc, or fixture.
- Added `shipguard ios devspace-check` after connector/plugin trials showed Devspace needed a first-class readiness report instead of relying on scattered docs and live MCP tests.
- Added a public `fixtures/ios-devspace/complete-preview` handoff so Devspace-check can test event receipts and target-resolution quality without private app code.
- Added `ios devspace-check --shareable` after report-quality showed otherwise-clean Devspace-check reports still needed local-path redaction before external sharing.
- Added `ios design --shareable` after the same shareability issue showed up in design/product-QA reports with local app and preview paths.
- Added `ios report-quality --shareable` after read-only Ringly/Ilmify design evals showed the quality artifact itself could carry local input/report paths even when the source reports were already shareable.
- Added a public report-quality actionability fixture and aggregated `Actionability Questions` output after full Ringly/Ilmify read-only evals showed useful source questions were not surfaced in the quality artifact.
- Added `ios performance --shareable` after read-only Ringly/Ilmify performance evals showed otherwise useful source reports still carried local project roots before report-quality scoring.
- Added `ios modernize --shareable`, `ios app-intelligence --shareable`, and `ios ai-readiness --shareable` after read-only Ringly/Ilmify checks showed those path-safe reports still lacked an explicit shareability contract.
- Added declared-shareability report-quality findings after read-only Ringly/Ilmify local-mode reports showed shareable scoring could pass reports that were path-clean but not explicitly generated for sharing.
- Added `shipguard ios spec-workflow` after clean read-only report-quality runs showed the missing step was converting actionability questions into proof-gated ShipGuard specs, tasks, slash plans, and Devspace guardrails.
- Added spec-workflow adoption quality findings after a misuse probe showed report-quality needed to distinguish report-grounded spec workflows from standalone polished plans.
- Added modernization rule summaries and capped Markdown for modernize, app-intelligence, and AI-readiness reports so private-app findings stay useful for improving ShipGuard without becoming app remediation tasks.
- Added the preview/Devspace routing fixture after read-only design-QA reports showed the iPhone visual-proof path needed to be enforced as a report-quality contract, not repeated as private-app advice.
- Improved first-run adoption docs around CLI versus plugin usage.
- Reworked the README after GitHub-facing evaluation showed the front page had become a noisy release-internals dump. The public entry point now leads with a short product promise, install, RepoVitals, prepare/verify, demo, and core docs, while detailed release and v4 proof work stays in dedicated docs. The same slice added `docs/install-doctor.md`, RepoVitals-style `shipguard doctor` output, and installed-CLI proof in `tests/install_doctor_test.sh`.
- Upgraded `shipguard next-goal` so the next improvement loop emits a reviewable `/plan` before the `/goal`, and can now carry bounded scope, completion evidence, and the following `/goal` handoff.
- Added Brand Deck actionability questions after a read-only `shipguard brand` plus `ios report-quality` pass showed the naming report was structurally clean but still produced the generic "add reportQualityQuestions" priority action instead of a concrete naming-system improvement.
- Expanded Brand Deck from an iOS-heavy surface list to a toolkit-wide naming contract after the full-renaming request showed root commands, release commands, CI tools, transcript tools, plugin status, and smaller preview handoff helpers also needed branded names and future coverage checks.
- Moved legacy command-wrapper guidance out of primary README and CLI flow into `docs/compatibility.md`.
- Keep Agents SDK deferred unless ShipGuard becomes a runnable agent service with a concrete eval target.
