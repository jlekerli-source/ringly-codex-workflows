# Command Matrix

`shipguard` is organized around the core maintainer jobs below. The whole toolkit workspace is the ShipGuard ShipYard; individual command families keep literal CLI names plus branded surface names and proof boundaries.

| Job | Command | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install workflow kit | `init ios`, `init web`, `init backend`, `init cli` | Starter workflow files |
| Check workflow kit | `validate` | Validation pass/fail |
| Check target repo setup | `doctor ios`, `doctor web`, `doctor backend`, `doctor cli` | Missing file report |
| Install local Codex plugin source | `codex plugin marketplace add .`, `codex plugin add ios-shipguard@shipguard` | Local plugin cache entry; new Codex thread required to load refreshed skill text |
| Check local Codex plugin install | `codex status` | Installed plugin metadata, stale branding, and missing-source report |
| Keep ShipGuard naming coherent | `brand`, `ios brand` | ShipGuard Brand Deck: toolkit-wide branded surface scheme, nitty-gritty file-family call signs, public-command coverage, active-doc coverage, stale wording checks, and future naming contract |
| Inspect iOS app topology | `ios doctor` | Xcode, SwiftPM, scheme, target, StoreKit, privacy manifest, and proof-readiness report |

| Audit iOS performance hotspots | `ios performance` | ShipGuard PulseRadar: ranked SwiftUI, body-work, GPU composition, image decoding, notification-cleanup findings with impact explanations, high-severity reasons, local/manual proof boundaries, grouped next actions with first experiments, validation routes, stop conditions, optional ShipGuard-only eval boundary, and shareable path-safe output |

| Generate iOS spec workflow | `ios spec-workflow` | ShipGuard SpecForge: constitution, feature spec, requirements checklist, native integration decisions, implementation plan, tasks, consistency analysis, analysis gates, slash plan/goal, Devspace guardrails, and report-quality artifact/question/acceptance/task/validation/analysis checks |
| Redact or evaluate iOS reports | `ios redact`, `ios report-quality`, `ios eval`, `ios demo` | Redacted local reports, shareable report-usefulness scoring with performance explanation, severity, proof-boundary, grouping, first-experiment, validation-route, and stop-condition checks, priority actions, actionability questions, fixture candidates, generated and consumed promotion manifests for materialized synthetic fixtures, materialized-fixture recursion guards, deterministic behavior evals, and clean first-run demo |
