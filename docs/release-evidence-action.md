# Release Evidence Action

`actions/release-evidence` turns verified release proof reports into a static evidence artifact in GitHub Actions. It expects the output from `actions/release-consume` and can include the output from `actions/release-diff`.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Export Codex maintainer release evidence

  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      release-tag:
        description: Release tag to verify.

      previous-tag:
        description: Previous release tag for diff proof.
        required: true
        default: v3.17.0

| `title` | `Codex Maintainer Release Evidence` | Title for the generated evidence site. |
| `include-diff` | `auto` | `auto` includes diff proof when present; `true` requires it; `false` skips it. |

| `artifact-name` | `codex-maintainer-release-evidence` | Uploaded artifact name. |
| `mode` | `fail` | `fail` fails invalid evidence; `warn` emits an annotation and continues. |

## Outputs

- `status`
- `site`
- `evidence-json`
- `site-readme`

The uploaded artifact contains `site/index.html`, `site/evidence.json`, copied source reports, and `index/evidence-index.json` when `build-index` is enabled.
