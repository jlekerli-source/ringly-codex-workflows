# Release Consume

`codex-maintainer release-consume verify` verifies a directory of downloaded release proof assets and writes a consumer-facing proof report.

Use it after downloading release assets from GitHub:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/codex-maintainer-v3.39.0
gh release download v3.39.0 \
  --repo jlekerli-source/ringly-codex-workflows \
  --pattern 'codex-maintainer-v3.39.0.tar.gz' \
  --pattern 'release-manifest.json' \
  --pattern 'release-index.json' \
  --pattern 'proof-ledger.md' \
  --dir /tmp/codex-maintainer-v3.39.0

./bin/codex-maintainer release-consume verify \
  --dir /tmp/codex-maintainer-v3.39.0 \
  --out /tmp/codex-maintainer-v3.39.0/consumer-proof \
  --version 3.39.0
```

Inputs expected in `--dir`:

- `codex-maintainer-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`
- `release-manifest.json`
- `release-index.json`
- `proof-ledger.md`

Outputs:

- `consumer-report.json`
- `consumer-report.md`
- `asset-digests.json`
- `asset-digests.md`
- `sha256.txt`
- `replay/replay-report.json`
- `replay/replay-report.md`
- `attestation/attestation.json`
- `attestation/attestation.md`
- `attestation/attestation-badge.json`

The digest matrix records each known release asset, its role, required or optional status, presence, byte count, and SHA-256 digest.

The command wraps:

```text
manifest parse -> digest matrix -> shasum -a 256 -> release-replay verify -> release-attest build -> consumer report
```

It fails when:

- the downloaded asset directory is missing required proof files
- `--version` does not match the release manifest
- the tarball SHA-256 does not match the manifest
- replay verification reports blocked checks
- attestation generation cannot prove a passing replay
- downloaded `replay-report.json`, `attestation.json`, or `attestation-badge.json` exists but does not match the locally regenerated proof

The published replay, attestation, and badge assets are compared by stable fields such as status, version, artifact SHA-256, blocked-check count, and badge message. Generated timestamps are intentionally ignored.

This command still does not download assets itself. Keeping download separate makes the reviewed files explicit and keeps the verifier local and deterministic.

For GitHub Actions usage, `actions/release-consume` wraps the download, verification, artifact upload, digest matrix, and regenerated attestation proof in one composite action. See `release-consume-action.md` and `examples/workflows/release-consume-verify.yml`.
