# ShipGuard V4 Release Candidate Readiness

`shipguard v4 release-candidate` is the local readiness gate before any stable v4 product claim.

It does not publish v4, change repository rules, edit private target apps, or claim marketplace acceptance. It checks whether the ShipGuard package is ready for an external developer to install, upgrade, uninstall, consume release proof, and understand the adoption packet without maintainer context.

## Command

```bash
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate \
  --path . \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate \
  --shipguard-eval \
  --shareable
```

To let LaunchKey download GitHub release assets and attach consumer proof to the same readiness report:

```bash
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate \
  --path . \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate \
  --package-tarball <release-tarball> \
  --upgrade-from-tarball <previous-release-tarball> \
  --fresh-install-prefix /tmp/shipguard-fresh-install \
  --upgrade-prefix /tmp/shipguard-upgrade-install \
  --rollback-prefix /tmp/shipguard-rollback-install \
  --download-release-assets \
  --github-release-repo <owner/repo> \
  --release-version <version> \
  --external-adoption-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> \
  --security-review-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> \
  --release-consume-out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-consume \
  --shipguard-eval \
  --shareable
```

Outputs:

- `v4-release-candidate.json`
- `v4-release-candidate.md`
- `fresh-install-prefix/bin/shipguard` when `--package-tarball` is supplied and `--fresh-install-prefix` is omitted
- `upgrade-prefix/bin/shipguard` when `--package-tarball` and `--upgrade-from-tarball` are supplied and `--upgrade-prefix` is omitted
- `rollback-prefix/` rollback cleanup evidence when `--package-tarball` is supplied and `--rollback-prefix` is omitted
- `downloaded-release-assets/` when `--download-release-assets` is supplied and `--download-release-assets-dir` is omitted
- `release-consume/consumer-report.json` when `--release-assets` or `--download-release-assets` is supplied and `--release-consume-out` is omitted

## Proof Contract

The command checks these gates:

- Fresh install proof: a release package can install to a clean prefix and run validation from that prefix.
- Upgrade proof: an existing install can be replaced by the candidate package and still report the intended version.
- Uninstall proof: temporary install state can be removed cleanly without hidden required state.
- Release proof consumption: native GitHub-downloaded or manually supplied release assets can pass `shipguard release-consume verify`.
- External adoption packet: an outside developer can see the first command, proof bundle, support boundary, and non-claims.
- External adoption evidence: redacted independent adoption records can be attached without pretending fixtures are real adoption or leaking private app details.
- Security review evidence: redacted final security review records can be attached without pretending fixtures are real security proof, hiding open critical/high findings, or leaking private app details.
- Final schema docs: v4 schema-freeze docs remain linked and visible.
- Plugin refresh proof: local Codex plugin refresh and `shipguard codex status --strict` remain part of the release lane.

Without `--package-tarball`, the command can still pass release-candidate readiness, but `freshInstallPackageProof.status` is `not-provided`. Stable-v4 proof needs a real package tarball to install into a fresh prefix, report the expected version through both `shipguard` and the compatibility alias, run `shipguard validate`, and prove the installed tree omits generated, VCS, cache, bytecode, dist, and AppleDouble files.

LaunchKey screens package tarballs before install. Archive members such as AppleDouble `._*`, `.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX`, bytecode, `.git`, `.cache`, `DerivedData`, and `__pycache__` block extraction even if a normal shell `tar -t` listing hides them. This matters for downloaded release assets: the release manifest and attestation can verify while the package is still unsafe to install on a clean machine. In that case, the report includes `blockingProof` and the result UX points to the exact blocked receipt, failure evidence, and package rebuild command.

When a fresh-install, upgrade, or rollback package blocks during safe extraction, LaunchKey attaches a compact `packageHygieneEvidence` snapshot from `shipguard release-package hygiene`. The snapshot names the first rule, tarball, affected version, unsafe member, blocked-finding count, and a read-only hygiene reproducer command. This keeps a stale previous-release package from producing a vague same-prefix upgrade failure.

When `--package-tarball` is supplied, LaunchKey runs:

```bash
PREFIX=<fresh-prefix> <package>/scripts/install.sh
<fresh-prefix>/bin/shipguard version
<fresh-prefix>/bin/codex-maintainer version
<fresh-prefix>/bin/shipguard validate
```

The report then records `freshInstallPackageProof`, including installed version, legacy alias version, validation result, forbidden installed path count, and redacted install paths. When fresh-install proof participates, the same block includes `freshInstallProofAttachment`, a compact handoff with install paths, version-check exits, validation exit, forbidden installed paths, missing proof artifacts, next command, and a boundary that source-only or fixture proof does not count as stable-v4 publication proof. If install or validation fails, the release-candidate report returns review instead of treating static package docs as fresh-install proof.

When package or release-asset inputs are supplied, the top `Readiness Proof` rows reflect the actual receipt status. A blocked supplied upgrade or release-consume receipt must show as blocked there too, not as pass just because the route exists.

When a supplied package, upgrade, rollback, or downloaded release-asset proof fails, the JSON contains:

- `blockingProof.receipt`: the failing receipt, such as `freshInstallPackageProof`.
- `blockingProof.failureEvidence`: the shortest useful stderr, extraction error, package-hygiene finding, or consumer-proof failure.
- `blockingProof.nextCommand`: the next command to repair or reproduce the failure.
- `resultUX.blockingProof`: the same detail in the top result block for agent and UI consumers.

When `--fresh-install-prefix`, `--fresh-install-work-dir`, `--upgrade-prefix`, `--upgrade-work-dir`, `--rollback-prefix`, `--rollback-work-dir`, `--download-release-assets-dir`, or `--release-consume-out` are omitted, LaunchKey writes generated proof directories under the candidate output. Those directories are evidence attachments, not report-quality source reports. `shipguard ios report-quality --reports <candidate-out>` skips `fresh-install-prefix`, `fresh-install-work`, `upgrade-prefix`, `upgrade-work`, `rollback-prefix`, `rollback-work`, `downloaded-release-assets`, and `release-consume` so it grades the root `v4-release-candidate.json` instead of recursively scoring installed packages, downloaded assets, or consumer-proof receipts. The report-quality output records those skipped JSON files in `skippedReportDiscovery` and renders `Skipped Generated Report Inputs` in Markdown so the exclusion is auditable.

Without `--upgrade-from-tarball`, the command can still pass release-candidate readiness, but `upgradePackageProof.status` is `not-provided`. Stable-v4 proof needs a previous release tarball plus the candidate tarball so LaunchKey can prove the same prefix upgrades from the previous package to the candidate package.

When `--upgrade-from-tarball` and `--package-tarball` are supplied, LaunchKey runs:

```bash
PREFIX=<upgrade-prefix> <previous-package>/scripts/install.sh
<upgrade-prefix>/bin/shipguard version
PREFIX=<same-upgrade-prefix> <candidate-package>/scripts/install.sh
<upgrade-prefix>/bin/shipguard version
<upgrade-prefix>/bin/codex-maintainer version
<upgrade-prefix>/bin/shipguard validate
```

The report then records `upgradePackageProof`, including previous installed version, upgraded version, compatibility alias version, validation result, forbidden installed path count, and redacted upgrade paths. When upgrade proof participates, the same block includes `upgradeProofAttachment`, a compact handoff with package paths, previous and upgraded version exits, validation exit, forbidden installed paths, missing proof artifacts, next command, and a boundary that source-only or fixture proof does not count as stable-v4 publication proof. If the previous package cannot install, the candidate package cannot replace it, validation fails, or the upgraded tree contains generated/VCS/cache files, the release-candidate report returns review.

When `--package-tarball` is supplied, LaunchKey also attaches `rollbackPackageProof`. It installs the candidate package into a temporary prefix, verifies the installed version, removes known ShipGuard package paths, and confirms no temporary ShipGuard package state remains:

```bash
PREFIX=<rollback-prefix> <candidate-package>/scripts/install.sh
<rollback-prefix>/bin/shipguard version
rm -rf <rollback-prefix>/bin/shipguard <rollback-prefix>/bin/codex-maintainer <rollback-prefix>/lib/shipguard
test ! -e <rollback-prefix>/bin/shipguard
test ! -e <rollback-prefix>/bin/codex-maintainer
test ! -e <rollback-prefix>/lib/shipguard
```

If `--package-tarball` is omitted, `rollbackPackageProof.status` is `not-provided`. When rollback proof participates, the same block includes `rollbackProofAttachment`, a compact handoff with temporary install paths, version-check exit, removed package paths, remaining package paths, missing proof artifacts, next command, and a boundary that source-only or fixture proof does not count as stable-v4 publication proof.

Without `--release-assets` or `--download-release-assets`, the command can still pass release-candidate readiness, but `publishedReleaseAssetProof.status` is `not-provided`. That is intentional: candidate readiness is not the same as stable-v4 proof. Stable-v4 release proof needs downloaded release assets to pass consumer-side verification.

When `--download-release-assets` is supplied, LaunchKey uses the GitHub release API, downloads every asset for `--release-version` from `--github-release-repo`, records `githubReleaseAssetDownloadProof`, and then runs consumer-side verification against the downloaded directory:

```bash
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate \
  --path . \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate \
  --download-release-assets \
  --github-release-repo <owner/repo> \
  --release-version <version> \
  --shipguard-eval \
  --shareable
```

Use `--download-release-assets-dir <dir>` to choose the destination, `--github-token-env <env>` to use a token for private or rate-limited release access, and `--github-api-url <url>` for GitHub Enterprise or deterministic fixture tests. If the download fails, `githubReleaseAssetDownloadProof.status` is `blocked`, `githubReleaseAssetDownloadProof.downloadBlockingProof` carries repo, tag, endpoint, download directory, error, next command, and proof boundary details, and `blockingProof.receipt` points at `githubReleaseAssetDownloadProof`.

When `--release-assets` is supplied, LaunchKey runs:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-consume verify \
  --dir <downloaded-assets-dir> \
  --out <consume-dir> \
  --version <version>
```

The report then records `publishedReleaseAssetProof`, including consumer report status, replay status, attestation status, digest matrix path, and artifact SHA-256 when available. When release assets participate, the same block includes `releaseAssetProofAttachment`, a compact handoff with the consumer report path, asset digest matrix path, missing proof artifacts, next release-consume command, and a boundary that source-only or fixture proof does not count as stable-v4 publication proof. If consumer verification fails, the release-candidate report returns review instead of treating the supplied assets as stable proof.

## External Adoption Evidence

Without `--external-adoption-evidence`, the command can still pass release-candidate readiness, but `externalAdoptionEvidenceProof.status` is `not-provided` and `externalAdoptionEvidenceStableGate` is `not-provided`. Stable-v4 proof needs independent evidence outside the ShipGuard maintainer loop.

Attach adoption evidence as JSON files:

```bash
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate \
  --path . \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate \
  --external-adoption-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> \
  --shipguard-eval \
  --shareable
```

Each JSON record must include `schemaVersion`, `evidenceType`, `evidenceClass`, `actorRelationship`, `generatedAt`, `status`, `privateDataRedacted`, `commands`, `artifacts`, `outcome`, and `nonClaims`. Stable-v4 eligible records must use `evidenceClass: public-external` or `private-redacted-external`, `actorRelationship: independent`, `status: pass`, `privateDataRedacted: true`, and either `consentToShare: true` or `shareableSummaryOnly: true`.

Synthetic fixture records can pass the structural evidence contract while keeping `stableV4GateStatus: review`. That is intentional: tests should prove the gate without faking real adoption. Invalid records, local private paths, private app identifiers, and token-like strings block with `blockingProof.receipt = externalAdoptionEvidenceProof`.

## Security Review Evidence

Without `--security-review-evidence`, the command can still pass release-candidate readiness, but `securityReviewEvidenceProof.status` is `not-provided` and `securityReviewEvidenceStableGate` is `not-provided`. Stable-v4 proof needs final security review evidence for the ShipGuard surfaces that can affect installation, plugin behavior, release proof, and privacy.

Attach security review evidence as JSON files:

```bash
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate \
  --path . \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate \
  --security-review-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> \
  --shipguard-eval \
  --shareable
```

Each JSON record must include `schemaVersion`, `evidenceType`, `evidenceClass`, `reviewerRelationship`, `generatedAt`, `status`, `privateDataRedacted`, `scope`, `methodology`, `commands`, `artifacts`, `findingsSummary`, and `nonClaims`. Stable-v4 eligible records must use `evidenceClass: public-security-review` or `private-redacted-security-review`, `reviewerRelationship: independent` or `maintainer-security-review`, `status: pass`, `privateDataRedacted: true`, and either `consentToShare: true` or `shareableSummaryOnly: true`.

The stable scope must cover `cli`, `plugin`, `github-actions`, `release-proof`, `package-install`, and `redaction-privacy`. `findingsSummary.criticalOpen` and `findingsSummary.highOpen` must both be `0`. Synthetic fixture records can pass the structural evidence contract while keeping `stableV4GateStatus: review`; invalid records, local private paths, private app identifiers, token-like strings, missing scope, and open critical/high findings block with `blockingProof.receipt = securityReviewEvidenceProof`.

## External Adoption Packet

Every release-candidate packet should answer:

- First command: `./bin/shipguard full-audit --path . --out /tmp/shipguard-full-audit --profile quick --shipguard-eval --shareable`
- Proof bundle: release manifest, release index, release replay, release consume report, and self-audit report.
- Support boundary: ShipGuard validates local proof and report quality; it does not run private app remediation unless explicitly asked.
- Non-claims: no OpenAI marketplace acceptance, no broad third-party adoption, and no private target-app validation are implied by the local readiness report.

## Required Validation

Use this minimum lane before claiming v4 release-candidate readiness:

```bash
git diff --check
./tests/v4_release_candidate_test.sh
./tests/tool_value_gauntlet_test.sh
./bin/shipguard validate
./bin/shipguard docs-check . --out /tmp/shipguard-docs-check
./tests/self_audit_test.sh
./tests/cli_smoke_test.sh
./tests/package_release_test.sh
codex plugin marketplace add .
codex plugin add ios-shipguard@shipguard
./bin/shipguard codex status --strict
```

For release assets, verify the consumer path too:

```bash
./bin/shipguard release-proof build --out /tmp/shipguard-release-proof --release-url <url> --version <version> --tag <tag> --commit <sha> --ci-run-url <url>
./bin/shipguard release-consume verify --dir <downloaded-assets-dir> --out /tmp/shipguard-release-consume --version <version>
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate --path . --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate --package-tarball <release-tarball> --upgrade-from-tarball <previous-release-tarball> --release-assets <downloaded-assets-dir> --release-version <version> --shipguard-eval --shareable
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate --path . --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate --package-tarball <release-tarball> --upgrade-from-tarball <previous-release-tarball> --download-release-assets --github-release-repo <owner/repo> --release-version <version> --shipguard-eval --shareable
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate --path . --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate --external-adoption-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> --shipguard-eval --shareable
./bin/shipguard v4 release-candidate --path . --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-release-candidate --security-review-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> --shipguard-eval --shareable
```

## Blocked Claims

Passing this report means ShipGuard is candidate-ready. It does not mean:

- ShipGuard v4 is a stable product release.
- OpenAI accepted ShipGuard into a public marketplace.
- External adoption has been proven by independent users.
- Third-party security certification has been completed.

After this report passes and a release is published, run `shipguard v4 stable-publication`. Stable publication is a separate proof gate that checks public GitHub release metadata, stable-v4 release notes, the LaunchKey candidate packet, downloaded release assets, post-release consumer proof, independent adoption evidence, and final security-review evidence before allowing the local stable-v4 claim.
- Any private app has been validated.
- Physical-device iOS behavior has been proven.
