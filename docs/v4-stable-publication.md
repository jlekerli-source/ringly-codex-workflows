# ShipGuard V4 Stable Publication Proof

`shipguard v4 stable-publication` is the final local proof gate before anyone says ShipGuard v4 is stable.

It does not publish a GitHub release, change repository rules, edit target apps, or claim marketplace acceptance. It reads public release metadata, release notes, a prior LaunchKey release-candidate report, release assets, release freshness, adoption evidence, and security-review evidence, then blocks stable-v4 claims until the full packet passes.

## Proof Boundary Quickstart

Use this order when you are trying to prove a stable public release:

1. Build the candidate packet with `v4 release-candidate`.
2. Publish or update the GitHub release manually with the required release-proof assets.
3. Run `v4 stable-publication --download-release-assets` against that public release.
4. Fill the generated `stable-publication-evidence-kit/` files with real external adoption and security-review evidence.
5. Rerun `v4 stable-publication` with those completed evidence files.

What counts:

- Public release assets plus `release-consume` prove consumer replay.
- Private app runs, local maintainer reviews, fixtures, and generated starter kits prove ShipGuard QA only.
- Independent adoption needs an external user, repo, install, issue, PR, or marketplace signal.
- Final security-review proof needs review evidence that covers the CLI, plugin, GitHub Action, release proof, package install, and redaction/privacy surfaces.

Do not claim stable v4 until `v4 stable-publication` returns `pass`.

## Command

```bash
./bin/shipguard v4 stable-publication \
  --path . \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-stable-publication \
  --release-version <version> \
  --release-candidate-report <v4-release-candidate-json-or-dir> \
  --download-release-assets \
  --external-adoption-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> \
  --security-review-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> \
  --shipguard-eval \
  --shareable
```

When `--github-release-repo` is omitted, ShipGuard tries to infer `<owner/repo>` from the target repo's `origin` remote. Pass the flag explicitly when validating a fork, mirror, fixture API, or non-`origin` publication target.

If release assets were already downloaded:

```bash
./bin/shipguard v4 stable-publication \
  --path . \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-v4-stable-publication \
  --release-version <version> \
  --release-candidate-report <v4-release-candidate-json-or-dir> \
  --release-assets <downloaded-assets-dir> \
  --external-adoption-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> \
  --security-review-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> \
  --shipguard-eval \
  --shareable
```

Outputs:

- `v4-stable-publication.json`
- `v4-stable-publication.md`
- `downloaded-release-assets/` when `--download-release-assets` is supplied and no custom destination is given
- `release-consume/consumer-report.json` when downloaded or supplied release assets are verified
- `release-consume/asset-digests.json` with required release asset rows, SHA-256 values, byte counts, and optional published proof assets

Repeated runs with `--download-release-assets` refresh the generated `downloaded-release-assets/` directory under `--out` before downloading again. Explicit `--download-release-assets-dir` paths remain caller-owned and keep the non-empty destination guard; `--release-assets` paths are caller-owned and never refreshed by ShipGuard.

## Stable Gates

The report returns `pass` only when every gate passes:

- GitHub release metadata exists for the requested tag, is not draft/prerelease, and includes the required release assets.
- Release notes pass the stable-publication topic matrix: stable-v4 claim, publication-proof boundary, downloaded release assets, post-release consumer proof, independent adoption evidence, final security review evidence, and non-claim boundaries.
- The supplied `v4 release-candidate` report is from LaunchKey, passed, and still claims only `candidate-ready`.
- Downloaded or supplied release assets pass `shipguard release-consume verify`.
- Post-release consumer proof is attached from the release assets.
- The post-release digest matrix covers required release assets, has SHA-256 values for present assets, and the release tarball digest matches the consumer artifact SHA-256.
- Public release freshness proves the GitHub tag target, `release-manifest.json` commit, release tag/version, release metadata target, and publication timestamp describe the same release.
- Release version coherence proves `VERSION`, the requested release version, GitHub metadata tag, `release-manifest.json`, release-consume package version, consumer report version, and versioned tarball name all describe the same release.
- Release asset coherence proves required asset names and SHA-256 values agree across GitHub metadata, downloaded or supplied release assets, `release-manifest.json`, `asset-digests.json`, and post-release consumer proof.
- External adoption evidence passes the stable-v4 gate with independent public or redacted external records, and the record `generatedAt` timestamp is no earlier than the release manifest timestamp.
- Final security-review evidence passes the stable-v4 gate with CLI, plugin, GitHub Actions, release-proof, package-install, and redaction/privacy scope coverage, and the record `generatedAt` timestamp is no earlier than the release manifest timestamp.

If any gate fails, the report returns `review`, sets `stableV4Release` to `false`, and puts the next command in `resultUX.nextCommand`.
The top result proof source and action use reader-facing labels such as `Closure Checklist`, `release notes`, and `LaunchKey candidate proof`; schema field names stay in structured JSON fields, not the maintainer-facing result.

## GitHub Release Metadata Closure Kit

When public GitHub release metadata is the first blocker, the `github-release-metadata` closure row carries `releaseMetadataClosureKit`.

The kit exposes:

- the selected `owner/repo`, repo inference source, release version, tag, API URL, release endpoint, release URL, published timestamp, and target commitish when available
- required stable-publication assets, metadata asset names, and metadata-missing assets
- draft and prerelease state, because neither state can satisfy stable-v4 publication proof
- release-note length, line count, SHA-256 digest, and missing topic IDs from the loaded metadata when available
- current metadata diagnostics, including the exact error when the endpoint cannot be loaded
- `releaseCreateCommand`, a copy-ready manual `gh release create ...` starter for the missing release, plus the notes file and required asset arguments
- `releaseCreateCommandBoundary`, which states that ShipGuard does not publish the release and that manual approval, passing package proof, and release-proof assets are required
- `postHandoffProof`, which gives the exact `gh release view ... --json tagName,isDraft,isPrerelease,targetCommitish,publishedAt,assets,url` verification command, the stable-publication rerun command, success criteria, and non-claims after the manual release-create action
- repair criteria, pass criteria, fail criteria, and the stable-publication rerun command
- `metadataProofBoundary`, which states that public GitHub release metadata is required and that source-only proof, draft/prerelease proof, and fixture API proof do not prove stable-v4 publication

Markdown renders these fields as `GitHub Release Metadata Closure Kit`, before lower-order blockers such as release notes, release assets, consumer proof, adoption evidence, or security evidence. This is repair guidance only; it does not publish or edit the GitHub release.

## Release Notes Proof

`releaseNotesProof` is a structured gate, not a keyword vibe check. The report analyzes the full GitHub release body, records a SHA-256 digest, counts lines, and emits `topicMatrix` plus `missingTopicIds`.

The release notes must mention:

- the stable-v4 release claim
- the publication or release-proof boundary
- downloaded release assets
- post-release consumer proof
- independent adoption evidence
- final security-review evidence
- non-claims or blocked claims

Markdown renders the same matrix under `Release Notes Proof` so maintainers can fix the public release text without reading JSON.

## Release Notes Authoring Kit

Every run also writes `stable-publication-release-notes/` inside the report directory.

This directory is a draft-only authoring aid, not proof that the public GitHub release was edited. It contains:

- `README.md` with public-release-body rules, the exact manual `gh release edit ... --notes-file <report-out>/stable-publication-release-notes/draft-release-notes.md` command, and the rerun command
- `release-notes-checklist.json` with the same topic matrix and missing topic IDs from `releaseNotesProof`
- `draft-release-notes.md` with a copy-ready stable-publication section covering release assets, post-release consumer proof, independent adoption, final security review, and non-claims
- `edit-walkthrough.md` with the manual edit step, stable-publication rerun proof command, and non-proof boundaries

The report exposes the same artifact as `stablePublicationReleaseNotesAuthoringKit`, including `generatedPaths` and `files[].generatedPath` for the generated README, checklist, and draft release notes. Markdown renders it under `Release Notes Authoring Kit`. `ios report-quality` flags stable-publication reports that expose release-note gaps but do not give maintainers a draft/checklist path and public GitHub edit command to fix the public release body.

When release notes are the first blocker, the report's first-blocking gate, result UX, and closure checklist `nextCommand` point at the manual `gh release edit` command. The stable-publication rerun command stays available as `rerunCommand` for after the public release body has been edited.

When public GitHub release metadata is missing and `publish-new-github-release` is the first required visibility action, result UX points at the manual `gh release create ...` handoff. The command is still a handoff only: ShipGuard does not create the release.

In `Release Visibility Handoff`, completed action rows use `nextCommand: not-needed`. The blocked `keep-current-public-release-unchanged` row uses `blocked-by-required-actions` until earlier gates pass. Only required review/blocker rows carry runnable commands, so a passed asset or publication action does not send maintainers into a fallback test or rerun lane.

The generated release-notes directory is an authoring attachment, not a separate source report. `ios report-quality` grades the root `v4-stable-publication.json` report and skips the generated checklist during recursive report discovery.

## Launch Relay Drafts

Every run also writes `stable-publication-launch-relay/` inside the report directory.

This directory is a draft-only launch packet for Product Hunt, r/ShipGuard, X, and Hacker News style announcements. It does not publish, submit, post, schedule, or perform account-visible external actions.

The packet contains:

- `README.md` with launch guardrails and the approval boundary
- `launch-relay-checklist.json` with `approvalRequired: true`, `publicPostingAllowed: false`, and `computerUseMayPost: false`
- `product-hunt-draft.md`
- `reddit-r-shipguard-draft.md`
- `x-thread-draft.md`
- `hacker-news-draft.md`

Public posting, publishing, submission, scheduling, browser-field staging with account side effects, or any other account-visible external action requires explicit human approval for that exact launch run. Computer-use may help prepare drafts or stage fields only after that approval; it must not post by default.

`ios report-quality` flags stable-publication reports that declare launch-relay actionability but hide the draft-only packet, omit the approval gate, allow public posting by default, or fail to render the approval boundary in Markdown.

## Evidence Packet

The JSON report includes `stablePublicationEvidencePacket` so humans and tools can inspect the real publication packet without piecing it together from scattered sections. It lists:

- all ten required evidence inputs with stable IDs and statuses
- whether each input is required for stable v4 and must be real evidence
- `missingEvidenceIds`
- `firstBlockingGate` with the exact next command
- proof order from LaunchKey candidate proof to published release proof
- non-claims for marketplace acceptance, fixture-only proof, and GitHub download counts

When the supplied LaunchKey report is blocked by package proof, stable publication preserves the nested blocker in `releaseCandidatePacketProof.launchKeyBlockingProof` and mirrors it into the candidate evidence row. For package hygiene failures this includes the blocked receipt, failure evidence, first hygiene rule, tarball/member, blocked-finding count, and the `shipguard release-package hygiene` reproducer command. Markdown renders the same details under `LaunchKey Candidate Blocker` so a maintainer does not have to open the nested candidate JSON before acting.

`ios report-quality` checks this packet. A stable-publication report that has the gates but hides the packet receives a report-quality issue.

## Closure Checklist

`stablePublicationClosureChecklist` turns the evidence packet into the maintainer's ordered closing list.

It includes:

- every non-passing stable-publication evidence gate in dependency order
- the first blocking gate marker without hiding later blockers
- an exact `nextCommand` for each remaining blocker
- proof-boundary language for what real evidence must pass
- `noHiddenLowerOrderBlockers` so report-quality can detect summaries that stop at only the first failure

Markdown renders the same table under `Closure Checklist`. A passing stable-publication report has zero checklist items; a blocked report must mirror every non-passing `stablePublicationEvidencePacket.requiredEvidence` row.

When release notes are a closure blocker, the release-notes row also carries a closure kit:

- `missingTopicIds` copied from `releaseNotesProof`
- `authoringKitPaths` for the generated README, checklist JSON, and draft release notes
- `publicGitHubReleaseEditBoundary`, which states that ShipGuard does not edit the public GitHub release body and the generated files are draft-only
- `rerunCommand`, the stable-publication command to run after editing the public release notes

Markdown renders those fields as `Release Notes Closure Kit` so the first blocker can be closed without opening nested JSON.

When the LaunchKey candidate packet is a closure blocker, the candidate row also carries a LaunchKey candidate closure kit:

- the supplied candidate report path, when a report was supplied
- the nested blocking receipt and status, synthesized from the first missing package proof when LaunchKey did not emit `blockingProof`
- required LaunchKey proof areas for fresh install, same-prefix upgrade, rollback cleanup, release asset download, release-consume, adoption evidence, and security review evidence
- compact package-hygiene diagnostics when present, including first rule/member/tarball and blocked-finding counts
- repair criteria, pass criteria, and fail criteria for closing the candidate blocker without editing proof reports
- a nested rerun command for the LaunchKey or package-hygiene blocker
- a full `stable-publication` rerun command to use after LaunchKey passes
- a fixture boundary that says LaunchKey fixture reports test ShipGuard routing but do not count as stable-v4 publication proof

Markdown renders those fields as `LaunchKey Candidate Closure Kit` so maintainers can fix candidate package lineage first, then rerun the full final publication gate without hiding later release notes, asset, adoption, or security blockers.

When downloaded release assets are a closure blocker, the row also carries a release asset closure kit:

- required stable-publication asset names from the public release contract
- GitHub release metadata asset names and metadata-missing assets
- downloaded or supplied local asset names and local missing assets
- download source, download proof status, asset directory, consumer output directory, command, exit code, and any error text when available
- repair criteria, pass criteria, and fail criteria for closing the release-assets gate without editing source or generated reports
- a `downloadAssetsRerunCommand` that downloads or points at the published release assets, a `releaseAssetUploadCommand` for the manual `gh release upload ... --clobber` handoff when verified local assets exist, a `postHandoffProof` receipt for verifying the upload through `gh release view ... --json tagName,isDraft,isPrerelease,targetCommitish,publishedAt,assets,url`, and a full `stablePublicationRerunCommand` for the final publication gate
- `releaseAssetProofBoundary`, which says downloaded or supplied public release assets are required, GitHub metadata alone does not count, source-only proof does not count, and fixture proof does not count as stable-v4 publication proof

Markdown renders these fields as `Release Asset Closure Kit` so maintainers can fix the public release asset packet before chasing the downstream post-release consumer proof.

When post-release consumer proof is a closure blocker, the row also carries a consumer closure kit:

- release-consume paths and statuses, including the consumer report path, asset digest matrix path, assets directory, consume output directory, version, command, exit code, stdout, stderr, and any error text when available
- missing proof artifacts such as `consumer-report.json` or `asset-digests.json`
- `consumerDigestFreshness`, including required asset names, present required assets, missing required assets, present assets missing SHA-256 values, release tarball digest, consumer artifact SHA-256, and the tarball-digest comparison
- replay, attestation, published replay, published attestation, and published badge crosscheck statuses
- repair criteria, pass criteria, and fail criteria for proving the downloaded or supplied release assets from the consumer side
- a `releaseConsumeRerunCommand` for the direct consumer proof and a full `stablePublicationRerunCommand` for the final publication gate
- `consumerProofBoundary`, which says release-consume verification is required, downloaded or supplied release assets are required, the digest matrix must cover required assets, the release tarball digest must match the consumer artifact, source-only proof does not count, fixture proof does not count as stable-v4 publication proof, and consumer proof does not prove adoption or security evidence

Markdown renders these fields as `Post-Release Consumer Closure Kit`, including `Digest freshness status`, so maintainers can see exactly why the consumer gate is still blocked and which proof artifact has to exist before any stable-v4 claim can move forward.

When public release freshness is a closure blocker, the row also carries a freshness closure kit:

- the public release tag, resolved GitHub tag target SHA, release `target_commitish`, release manifest path, manifest commit, and manifest generation timestamp
- comparison rows for requested version, metadata tag, tag-target commit, release target commit when it is a SHA, and manifest timestamp freshness
- current freshness diagnostics, problems, repair criteria, pass criteria, fail criteria, and the full stable-publication rerun command
- `freshnessProofBoundary`, which says public tag target plus release manifest proof is required, the manifest commit must match the public tag target, and source-only or fixture API proof cannot satisfy stable-v4 freshness

Markdown renders these fields as `Public Release Freshness Closure Kit` so stale tags, rebuilt assets, or mismatched release manifests are visible before adoption/security evidence is chased.

## Release Version Coherence

Stable publication emits `releaseVersionCoherenceProof` after public release freshness and before external adoption/security evidence.

The proof compares:

- source `VERSION`
- requested release version and normalized tag
- returned GitHub release metadata tag name
- `release-manifest.json` version, tag, and artifact name
- release-consume package version and `consumer-report.json` version
- the expected versioned tarball name in metadata and digest assets

Markdown renders this as `Release Version Coherence`. A stable-v4 claim cannot pass if any of those fields point at a different release.

## Release Asset Coherence

Stable publication emits `releaseAssetCoherenceProof` after version coherence and before external adoption/security evidence.

The proof compares:

- required release asset names
- GitHub metadata asset names
- downloaded or supplied local asset names
- `asset-digests.json` asset rows
- the expected versioned ShipGuard tarball name
- the release manifest artifact name and SHA-256
- the digest tarball row name and SHA-256
- the consumer artifact SHA-256

Markdown renders this as `Release Asset Coherence`. A stable-v4 claim cannot pass if the public asset packet is missing required assets, omits digest rows, lacks SHA-256 values, or points the manifest, digest matrix, and consumer report at different tarballs.

If the coherence repair has all required local asset files, the closure checklist and Markdown include a concrete manual `gh release upload <tag> --repo <owner/repo> --clobber ...` command plus the same post-handoff proof receipt. ShipGuard still does not upload or replace GitHub release assets itself.

## Public Evidence Closure

Stable publication emits `publicEvidenceClosureProof` as the copy-ready summary for independent adoption and final security-review evidence.

The proof lists both evidence rows with gate status, freshness status, stable-v4 eligible record counts, fresh/stale record counts, starter paths, template copy commands, the full stable-publication rerun command, and non-claims. It is deliberately a summary of the adoption/security gates, not a new way to manufacture evidence.

Markdown renders this as `Public Evidence Closure` plus `External Evidence Source-Class Matrix`. The matrix names accepted evidence classes, the required actor/reviewer relationship field, accepted relationships, rejected substitutes, and the pass boundary for independent adoption and final security review. A stable-v4 claim cannot pass if adoption/security proof is missing, stale, fixture-only, source-only, based on GitHub downloads, or framed as marketplace acceptance or external launch proof.

## Public Release Delta

Stable publication emits `publicReleaseDeltaProof` to show whether the selected release, latest GitHub release, downloaded or supplied package assets, local `HEAD`, local `main`, release-manifest commit, and stable-v4 claim scope are aligned.

This is claim context, not a new stable-publication gate. A published release can still be proven after local `main` moves on, but the report must make that delta visible so unpublished local code is not described as released.

Markdown renders this as `Public Release Delta`.

Important fields:

- `latestGitHubReleaseVersion` and `latestGitHubReleaseTag`
- `sourceVersion`, `releaseVersion`, and `packageVersion`
- `localHeadCommit`, `localMainCommit`, `selectedPublicReleaseCommit`, and `releaseManifestCommit`
- `unpublishedLocalDelta`
- `stableV4ClaimCoversSelectedPublicRelease`
- `stableV4ClaimCoversLocalCheckout`
- `releaseDeltaBoundary.unpublishedLocalCodeCountsAsReleased = false`

`ios report-quality` flags full stable-publication reports that hide this block, weaken the unpublished-code boundary, or allow stable-v4 claim wording when the selected public release is not covered.

## Release Visibility Handoff

Stable publication emits `releaseVisibilityHandoff` to turn the release delta into the next public-release action.

The handoff answers one maintainer question: do we publish a new GitHub release, update release notes, attach LaunchKey candidate proof, update release assets, attach adoption/security evidence, or keep the current public release unchanged?

Markdown renders this as `Release Visibility Handoff`, including action-level next commands.
Each action also classifies the command purpose and the proof command to run after completion, so a manual GitHub edit does not look like a local proof rerun.

Important fields:

- `primaryDecision`
- `currentPublicReleaseCanBeAnnounced`
- `localMainCanBeAnnounced`
- `requiredActions[]` for `publish-new-github-release`, `update-release-notes`, `attach-launchkey-candidate-proof`, `update-release-assets`, `attach-adoption-security-evidence`, and `keep-current-public-release-unchanged`
- `requiredActions[].nextCommand`, where `update-release-notes` points at the generated `gh release edit ... --notes-file <report-out>/stable-publication-release-notes/draft-release-notes.md` command when release notes are the blocker
- `requiredActions[].nextCommandPurpose`, such as `manual-github-release-notes-edit`, so maintainers can tell whether the row mutates GitHub, records evidence, or runs local proof
- `requiredActions[].proofCommandAfterCompletion`, usually the stable-publication rerun command after manual GitHub or evidence work
- `visibilityBoundary.unpublishedLocalCodeCountsAsReleased = false`

The handoff does not publish, edit a GitHub release, or post externally. It makes the next release action explicit while keeping local `HEAD`/`main` deltas advisory: a selected public release can still be the announcement target when stable-publication evidence passes for that release.

## Final Stable V4 Claim Packet

Stable publication emits `finalStableV4ClaimPacket` so the last report answers the maintainer question directly: what can I safely say now?

The packet includes the claim decision, copy-ready allowed or blocked wording, evidence status rows, missing evidence IDs, first blocking gate, next command, public evidence closure status, public-release delta summary, explicit posting approval boundary, and non-claims for source-only proof, fixtures, GitHub downloads, marketplace acceptance, and external posting.

Markdown renders this as `Final Stable V4 Claim Packet`. A blocked report says not to claim stable v4 yet and names the first blocker; a passing report gives bounded stable-v4 wording without claiming marketplace acceptance or public launch posting.

When `publicReleaseDeltaProof.unpublishedLocalDelta` is true, the final claim packet also renders `Final claim public-release delta` after the evidence table, and the copy-ready wording warns that local `HEAD` or `main` must not be described as released until a new public release passes.

## External Evidence Freshness

Stable publication also emits `evidencePacketFreshness` inside both `externalAdoptionEvidenceProof` and `securityReviewEvidenceProof`.

The freshness check compares stable-v4 eligible evidence record `generatedAt` values with the release manifest timestamp from the downloaded or supplied release assets. If otherwise valid adoption or security evidence predates that release packet, the corresponding stable-v4 gate is downgraded to `review`.

Markdown renders these rows as `External Evidence Freshness`, including the reference timestamp, fresh/stale stable record counts, and the boundary that source-only, fixture, or local package proof cannot refresh external evidence.

When independent adoption or final security-review evidence is a closure blocker, the row also carries an evidence closure kit:

- the generated starter file path and source template path
- accepted `evidenceClass` values and required JSON fields
- required security scope for final security review evidence
- redaction and privacy boundaries, including private path, app identifier, screenshot, token, and account-data exclusions
- pass criteria and common fail criteria, including unchanged templates, missing redaction, fixture evidence, missing security scope, and open critical/high findings
- current diagnostics from the supplied evidence proof, such as record counts, first error, missing fields, missing security scope, and evidence packet freshness
- `rerunCommand`, the stable-publication command to run after attaching real adoption/security evidence

Markdown renders these fields as `Evidence Closure Kit: <evidence-id>` so maintainers can close the adoption/security blockers without reverse-engineering template JSON or nested proof records.

## Evidence Starter Kit

Every run also writes `stable-publication-evidence-kit/` inside the report directory.

This directory is a convenience artifact, not proof. It contains:

- `README.md` with the collection rules and next command template
- `stable-publication-checklist.json` with the current ten-gate packet, closure checklist, first blocker, missing evidence IDs, and non-claims
- `public-proof-walkthrough.md` with the maintainer-facing proof order and proof-class boundaries
- `external-adoption-evidence.json` copied from the draft-only adoption template
- `security-review-evidence.json` copied from the draft-only security-review template

The generated README, checklist, and main stable-publication Markdown report also include an evidence ladder:

- public consumer proof can be produced by the maintainer from public release assets, but proves consumability rather than adoption
- private maintainer QA from Ringly, Ilmify, or other maintainer apps can expose ShipGuard product gaps, but does not count as independent adoption
- independent adoption evidence requires a non-maintainer user, repo, issue, PR, or redacted external install report
- final security-review evidence requires a review record for ShipGuard's CLI, plugin, GitHub Actions, release proof, package install, and redaction/privacy surfaces with no open critical/high findings

The report exposes the same information in `stablePublicationEvidenceStarterKit`. In schema v2, the starter kit also carries:

- `releaseVersion`, so the local starter files stay tied to the public release packet being closed
- `relatedAuthoringKits`, currently linking to `stable-publication-release-notes`, its status, missing topics, files, and rerun command

`ios report-quality` flags stable-publication reports that do not write or render this starter kit, and flags schema-v2 starter kits that lose the release version or release-notes authoring-kit link, because the final publication gate should be actionable without making maintainers reverse-engineer JSON shapes from source code.

Starter-kit files are intentionally not pass-ready. Fill them with real reviewed evidence, redact private details, and pass the completed files back with `--external-adoption-evidence` and `--security-review-evidence`.
The generated README also lists the exact fields that must change before the adoption and security-review starter records can pass, including independent actor relationship, accepted evidence classes, required security scope coverage, `privateDataRedacted: true`, and the ban on substituting private app runs, fixture reports, generated starter files, stars, downloads, or vague testimonials for external evidence.

## Evidence Templates

Stable publication also exposes draft-only evidence templates:

- `templates/stable-publication/external-adoption-evidence.template.json`
- `templates/stable-publication/security-review-evidence.template.json`

The report includes those paths, accepted evidence classes, required fields, copy commands, and validation commands in `stablePublicationEvidenceTemplates`. The adoption and security entries inside `stablePublicationEvidencePacket.requiredEvidence` also link back to their template path and copy command.

These templates are intentionally not pass-ready. They default to `status: draft`, `privateDataRedacted: false`, and consent fields that must be reviewed before the record can pass. Copy them into a private evidence directory, replace placeholder text with real reviewed evidence, redact local paths/private app details/token-like strings/account data, then pass the completed file or directory to `--external-adoption-evidence` or `--security-review-evidence`.

Example:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/shipguard-stable-evidence
cp templates/stable-publication/external-adoption-evidence.template.json /tmp/shipguard-stable-evidence/external-adoption-evidence.json
cp templates/stable-publication/security-review-evidence.template.json /tmp/shipguard-stable-evidence/security-review-evidence.json
```

## Evidence Boundary

`stable-publication` intentionally sits after `v4 release-candidate`.

`v4 release-candidate` proves the package and release packet are candidate-ready. It can use public fixtures to prove the workflow works. `v4 stable-publication` proves the actual published release by reading public release metadata, real release notes, downloaded release assets, public tag/manifest freshness, independent adoption evidence, and final security-review evidence. Synthetic fixture adoption or security records can prove the tool path, but they do not prove stable-v4 publication. Source-only and fixture proof do not count as release freshness or post-release `release-consume` consumer proof.

Use `--shareable` before moving this report into GitHub, ChatGPT planning, public docs, or release evidence. Shareable output redacts local paths while preserving proof status, gate names, and next commands.

## Blocked Claims

Passing earlier v4 reports does not mean:

- ShipGuard v4 is stable.
- The GitHub release assets were downloaded and consumed by a fresh user.
- The public GitHub tag target matches the uploaded release manifest commit.
- Independent adoption happened.
- Final security review happened.
- OpenAI accepted ShipGuard into a public marketplace.

Only a passing `v4 stable-publication` report allows the local stable-v4 release claim.
