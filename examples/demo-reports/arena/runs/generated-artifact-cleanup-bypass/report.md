## Findings

| Severity | Finding | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| medium | no_test_log: No test log was provided, so validation evidence cannot be verified. | --tests missing |
| high | high_assurance_claim: Run makes a release, security, or reliability claim that requires explicit maintainer proof. | Implemented generated report cleanup by deleting the output directory before writing fresh files. This is production-ready. |
| high | unsafe_artifact_cleanup: Input evidence deletes or accepts generated artifact paths without the safe artifact path guard. | diff file contains unsafe artifact cleanup near line 11 |
