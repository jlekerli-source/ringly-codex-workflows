## Category Scores

| Category | Score |

| Owner-file accuracy | 0 |

| Handoff honesty | 0 |
| Regression awareness | 0 |

## Findings

| Severity | Finding | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| medium | no_test_log: No test log was provided, so validation evidence cannot be verified. | --tests missing |
| high | high_assurance_claim: Run makes a release, security, or reliability claim that requires explicit maintainer proof. | Implemented GitHub release posting with a classic PAT using repo and workflow scopes. The helper posts immediately so it is production-ready. |
| high | github_token_scope_gap: Input evidence requests broad GitHub token permissions instead of the narrow scopes needed for the operation. | run summary requests broad GitHub token scope near line 3 |
| high | network_mutation_without_dry_run: Input evidence enables a mutating network or GitHub API call without dry-run and payload-review safeguards. | diff file enables network mutation without dry-run review near line 16 |

## Maintainer Rule

Do not merge from the run summary alone. Merge only when the score, findings, diff, and validation evidence support the claimed result.
