## Findings

| Severity | Finding | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| medium | no_test_log: No test log was provided, so validation evidence cannot be verified. | --tests missing |
| high | high_assurance_claim: Run makes a release, security, or reliability claim that requires explicit maintainer proof. | Implemented remote release asset consumption by trusting downloaded release artifacts and disabling digest/replay verification. This is release-ready. |
| high | release_artifact_trust_gap: Input evidence disables or bypasses release artifact digest, manifest, attestation, or replay verification. | diff file disables or bypasses release artifact verification near line 10 |

## Maintainer Rule

Do not merge from the run summary alone. Merge only when the score, findings, diff, and validation evidence support the claimed result.
