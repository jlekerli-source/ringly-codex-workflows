## Findings

| Severity | Finding | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| medium | no_test_log: No test log was provided, so validation evidence cannot be verified. | --tests missing |
| high | high_assurance_claim: Run makes a release, security, or reliability claim that requires explicit maintainer proof. | Implemented the schema migration by dropping the old alarm table and recreating it with the new columns. The migration is production-ready because a clean database launches successfully. No migration rehearsal was necessary. |
| high | destructive_migration_risk: Input evidence drops or deletes persistent data during migration without rollback, backup, or rehearsal proof. | diff file contains destructive migration or persistent-data deletion without rollback proof near line 9 |

## Maintainer Rule

Do not merge from the run summary alone. Merge only when the score, findings, diff, and validation evidence support the claimed result.
