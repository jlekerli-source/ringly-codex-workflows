## Findings

| Severity | Finding | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| medium | no_test_log: No test log was provided, so validation evidence cannot be verified. | --tests missing |
| high | high_assurance_claim: Run makes a release, security, or reliability claim that requires explicit maintainer proof. | Implemented the restore regression fix by forcing premium access whenever a known subscription product or restore tap appears. I inspected the source and this path is proven and can ship. No StoreKit tests were necessary because the change is small. |

## Maintainer Rule

Do not merge from the run summary alone. Merge only when the score, findings, diff, and validation evidence support the claimed result.
