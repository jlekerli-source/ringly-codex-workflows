- Target release: v3.105.0
- Title: ShipGuard Command-Family Output Receipts And Product Strategy

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.105.0 ShipGuard Command-Family Output Receipts And Product Strategy for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Add commandFamilyRuntimeOutputReceipts to value-gauntlet, add public major-family report-output receipt proof, advance the next weak surface to trust-hardening receipts, add product-strategy guidance from the 5.5 Pro roadmap critique, package NEXT_GOAL.md, and keep extracted packages aligned with source value-gauntlet proof.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.105.0 ShipGuard Command-Family Output Receipts And Product Strategy for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Add commandFamilyRuntimeOutputReceipts to value-gauntlet, add public major-family report-output receipt proof, advance the next weak surface to trust-hardening receipts, add product-strategy guidance from the 5.5 Pro roadmap critique, package NEXT_GOAL.md, and keep extracted packages aligned with source value-gauntlet proof, push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Add commandFamilyRuntimeOutputReceipts to value-gauntlet, add public major-family report-output receipt proof, advance the next weak surface to trust-hardening receipts, add product-strategy guidance from the 5.5 Pro roadmap critique, package NEXT_GOAL.md, and keep extracted packages aligned with source value-gauntlet proof.

## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: Add commandFamilyRuntimeOutputReceipts to value-gauntlet, add public major-family report-output receipt proof, advance the next weak surface to trust-hardening receipts, add product-strategy guidance from the 5.5 Pro roadmap critique, package NEXT_GOAL.md, and keep extracted packages aligned with source value-gauntlet proof.
- Evidence: Implemented scripts/tool_value_gauntlet.py commandFamilyRuntimeOutputReceipts with fixtures/tool-value-gauntlet/command-family-runtime-output-receipts/major-family-report-outputs/receipt.json; added tests/command_family_runtime_output_receipts_test.sh and updated tests/tool_value_gauntlet_test.sh; added docs/product-strategy.md and roadmap/docs/skill guidance; packaged NEXT_GOAL.md; validation passed: git diff --check, ./bin/shipguard validate, ./tests/command_family_runtime_output_receipts_test.sh, ./tests/tool_value_gauntlet_test.sh, ./tests/self_audit_test.sh, ./tests/next_goal_test.sh, ./tests/cli_smoke_test.sh, ./bin/shipguard docs-check . --out /tmp/shipguard-docs-check-v3105b, and ./tests/package_release_test.sh.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.106.0 ShipGuard Trust-Hardening Receipts And Proof-Gated Task Contract for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.106.0 ShipGuard Trust-Hardening Receipts And Proof-Gated Task Contract for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the following /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.106.0 --title "ShipGuard Trust-Hardening Receipts And Proof-Gated Task Contract" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private app source, paths, screenshots, app identifiers, or secrets.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.105.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Create release `v3.105.0` and upload `dist/shipguard-v3.105.0.tar.gz`.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
