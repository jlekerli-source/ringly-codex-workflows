- Title: Notification Scope Specificity Fixture QA

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.158.0 Notification Scope Specificity Fixture QA for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Run fresh verify-first report-quality on the public quickstart reports, start from the now-uncovered notification/permission scope-specificity question, and improve ShipGuard only by turning the gap into public fixtures, report-quality rules, docs, and tests. Keep private app targets read-only.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.158.0 Notification Scope Specificity Fixture QA for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Run fresh verify-first report-quality on the public quickstart reports, start from the now-uncovered notification/permission scope-specificity question, and improve ShipGuard only by turning the gap into public fixtures, report-quality rules, docs, and tests. Keep private app targets read-only, push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Run fresh verify-first report-quality on the public quickstart reports, start from the now-uncovered notification/permission scope-specificity question, and improve ShipGuard only by turning the gap into public fixtures, report-quality rules, docs, and tests. Keep private app targets read-only.

## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: v3.157 promoted unsupported-claim replay fixture coverage. shipguard verify now emits unsupportedClaimReplay with separate unsupported, rejected, and manual-proof claim rows; Markdown renders Unsupported Claim Replay plus non-claims; ios report-quality fails missing or weak replay sections; self-audit/package proof include the promoted fixture.
- Evidence: git diff --check; python3 -m py_compile scripts/task_contract.py scripts/ios_report_quality.py; ./tests/verify_first_quickstart_test.sh; ./tests/task_contract_test.sh; ./tests/ios_report_quality_test.sh; ./bin/shipguard validate; ./bin/shipguard docs-check . --out /tmp/shipguard-v3157-docs-check; ./tests/self_audit_test.sh; ./tests/cli_smoke_test.sh; ./tests/package_release_test.sh; ./bin/shipguard value-gauntlet --path . --out /tmp/shipguard-v3157-value-gauntlet; codex plugin marketplace add . && codex plugin add ios-shipguard@shipguard && ./bin/shipguard codex status --strict.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.159.0 Structured Receipt Proof-Lane Specificity Fixture QA for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.159.0 Structured Receipt Proof-Lane Specificity Fixture QA for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.159.0 --title "Structured Receipt Proof-Lane Specificity Fixture QA" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private app source, paths, screenshots, app identifiers, or secrets.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.158.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Create release `v3.158.0` and upload `dist/shipguard-v3.158.0.tar.gz`.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
