# Next Goal

- Generated: 2026-06-23T21:18:41Z
- Current toolkit version: 3.202.0
- Target release: v3.203.0
- Title: Stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture polish

## Version Lineage Check

- Status: pass
- VERSION: 3.202.0
- Expected next release from VERSION: v3.203.0
- Planned target release: v3.203.0
- Current checkout package artifact before version bump: dist/shipguard-v3.202.0.tar.gz
- Expected package artifact after release bump: dist/shipguard-v3.203.0.tar.gz
- Action: Before publishing v3.203.0, bump VERSION to 3.203.0, rebuild, and verify dist/shipguard-v3.203.0.tar.gz.

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.203.0 Stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture polish for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Polish the stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture and index copy so maintainers can see accepted source classes, relationship fields, rejected substitutes, pass boundaries, and the next evidence-quality refinement without reading nested JSON or confusing fixture coverage with adoption/security proof.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, bump VERSION before release packaging, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.203.0 Stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture polish for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Polish the stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture and index copy so maintainers can see accepted source classes, relationship fields, rejected substitutes, pass boundaries, and the next evidence-quality refinement without reading nested JSON or confusing fixture coverage with adoption/security proof, push main, verify GitHub Actions, bump VERSION before publishing the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Polish the stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture and index copy so maintainers can see accepted source classes, relationship fields, rejected substitutes, pass boundaries, and the next evidence-quality refinement without reading nested JSON or confusing fixture coverage with adoption/security proof.

## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: v3.202.0 promoted a public source-class fixture proving stable-publication reports keep accepted evidence classes, actor/reviewer relationships, rejected substitutes, pass boundaries, and Markdown visibility regression-covered.
- Evidence: Commit 42a9ec16 pushed to main; GitHub Actions run 28057502173 completed success; local package tarball dist/shipguard-v3.202.0.tar.gz SHA-256 faa5d900bf139fec0f773739937c5eff58e59efb672c6816e105b44127c5d624; ./bin/shipguard codex status --strict passed after local CLI refresh.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.204.0 Stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture next-gap promotion for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.204.0 Stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture next-gap promotion for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.204.0 --title "Stable-publication external evidence source-class fixture next-gap promotion" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private app source, paths, screenshots, app identifiers, or secrets.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.203.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Bump VERSION to 3.203.0, build `dist/shipguard-v3.203.0.tar.gz`, create release `v3.203.0`, and upload the rebuilt tarball.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
