# Next Goal

- Generated: 2026-06-17T17:35:03Z
- Current toolkit version: 3.38.0
- Target release: v3.54.0
- Title: Spec Workflow Artifact Content Quality Gate

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.54.0 Spec Workflow Artifact Content Quality Gate for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Make ios report-quality flag ios spec-workflow artifacts whose generated files exist but contain placeholder-only or structurally weak content, so present-but-useless spec bundles do not pass adoption scoring.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.54.0 Spec Workflow Artifact Content Quality Gate for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Make ios report-quality flag ios spec-workflow artifacts whose generated files exist but contain placeholder-only or structurally weak content, so present-but-useless spec bundles do not pass adoption scoring, push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Make ios report-quality flag ios spec-workflow artifacts whose generated files exist but contain placeholder-only or structurally weak content, so present-but-useless spec bundles do not pass adoption scoring.

## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: Make ios report-quality flag ios spec-workflow artifacts whose generated files exist but contain placeholder-only or structurally weak content, so present-but-useless spec bundles do not pass adoption scoring.
- Evidence: A fixture product-QA probe replaced tasks.md and devspace-guardrails.md in a valid spec-workflow bundle with TODO placeholder text; before the change, ios report-quality returned pass, and after the change it returns review with spec-workflow-artifact-content-incomplete and spec-workflow-artifact-placeholder-content without leaking temp paths. A read-only Ringly/Ilmify ShipGuard product-QA loop produced shareable design/performance reports, generated a report-grounded spec workflow, passed report-quality for the complete bundle, and flagged the intentionally weakened bundle without leaking private app paths. Validated with python3 -m py_compile scripts/ios_report_quality.py scripts/ios_spec_workflow.py; ./tests/ios_spec_workflow_test.sh; ./tests/ios_report_quality_test.sh; and the read-only Ringly/Ilmify spec-workflow artifact content loop.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.55.0 Spec Workflow Question Coverage Gate for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.55.0 Spec Workflow Question Coverage Gate for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the following /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.55.0 --title "Spec Workflow Question Coverage Gate" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private Ringly, Ilmify, or other product source.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.54.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Create release `v3.54.0` and upload `dist/shipguard-v3.54.0.tar.gz`.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
