# Next Goal

- Generated: 2026-06-17T21:08:17Z
- Current toolkit version: 3.59.0
- Target release: v3.68.0
- Title: Performance First Experiment Gate

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.68.0 Performance First Experiment Gate for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Add a smallest reversible firstExperiment to grouped ios performance actions, render it in Markdown before broad first-move advice, and make ios report-quality fail grouped performance output that hides first experiments from JSON or Markdown.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.68.0 Performance First Experiment Gate for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Add a smallest reversible firstExperiment to grouped ios performance actions, render it in Markdown before broad first-move advice, and make ios report-quality fail grouped performance output that hides first experiments from JSON or Markdown, push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Add a smallest reversible firstExperiment to grouped ios performance actions, render it in Markdown before broad first-move advice, and make ios report-quality fail grouped performance output that hides first experiments from JSON or Markdown.

## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: Add a smallest reversible firstExperiment to grouped ios performance actions, render it in Markdown before broad first-move advice, and make ios report-quality fail grouped performance output that hides first experiments from JSON or Markdown.
- Evidence: A public read-only full-report ShipGuard product-QA loop over fixtures/demo-ios-repo passed report-quality but prioritized 'Did grouped next actions name the smallest first experiment before broad refactors?' because groupedActionPlan only had broad recommendedFirstMove advice. After the change, ios performance emits firstExperiment in every grouped action, Markdown renders a First experiment column, ios report-quality flags performance-grouped-first-experiment-missing and performance-markdown-first-experiment-missing, the same read-only full-report loop passed with zero findings, and priorityAction advanced to 'Did grouped first experiments name a clear validation route and stop condition before broader refactors?'. Validated with python3 -m py_compile scripts/ios_performance.py scripts/ios_report_quality.py; ./tests/ios_performance_test.sh; ./tests/ios_report_quality_test.sh; git diff --check; ./bin/shipguard validate; ./tests/cli_smoke_test.sh; ./tests/ios_shipguard_eval_test.sh; ./bin/shipguard docs-check . --out /tmp/shipguard-v368-docs-check; ./tests/self_audit_test.sh; ./tests/next_goal_test.sh; ./tests/package_release_test.sh; the full public fixture report-quality loop under /tmp/shipguard-loop-v368-after; codex plugin marketplace add .; codex plugin add ios-shipguard@shipguard; ./bin/shipguard codex status --strict; and installed-cache grep for performance-grouped-first-experiment guidance.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.69.0 Performance Experiment Stop Condition Gate for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.69.0 Performance Experiment Stop Condition Gate for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the following /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.69.0 --title "Performance Experiment Stop Condition Gate" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private Ringly, Ilmify, or other product source.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.68.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Create release `v3.68.0` and upload `dist/shipguard-v3.68.0.tar.gz`.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
