- Title: ShipGuard iOS Notification Permission Workflow

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.115.0 ShipGuard iOS Notification Permission Workflow for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Build the first domain-specific vertical workflow on top of diff-first prepare/verify: add an iOS notification and permission risk pack that discovers permission-sensitive files, proposes narrow authorized/review-only/forbidden scopes, emits exact validation receipt requirements, separates simulator proof from physical-device prompt proof, rejects unsupported completion claims, and returns one exact next action. Keep the work ShipGuard-only: private Ringly and Ilmify evidence may be read-only QA only, and all reusable behavior must be proven with public synthetic fixtures.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.115.0 ShipGuard iOS Notification Permission Workflow for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Build the first domain-specific vertical workflow on top of diff-first prepare/verify: add an iOS notification and permission risk pack that discovers permission-sensitive files, proposes narrow authorized/review-only/forbidden scopes, emits exact validation receipt requirements, separates simulator proof from physical-device prompt proof, rejects unsupported completion claims, and returns one exact next action. Keep the work ShipGuard-only: private Ringly and Ilmify evidence may be read-only QA only, and all reusable behavior must be proven with public synthetic fixtures, push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Build the first domain-specific vertical workflow on top of diff-first prepare/verify: add an iOS notification and permission risk pack that discovers permission-sensitive files, proposes narrow authorized/review-only/forbidden scopes, emits exact validation receipt requirements, separates simulator proof from physical-device prompt proof, rejects unsupported completion claims, and returns one exact next action. Keep the work ShipGuard-only: private Ringly and Ilmify evidence may be read-only QA only, and all reusable behavior must be proven with public synthetic fixtures.

## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: v3.114.0 ShipGuard Diff-First Verification Verdict shipped with structured validation receipts and diff-first merge verdicts.
- Evidence: v3.114.0 shipped diff-first task contracts with bounded project snapshots, generic iOS scope discovery, structured validation receipts, evidence coverage, diffFirstAnalysis, strict pass/review/blocked/incomplete verdicts, and release proof at https://github.com/jlekerli-source/ShipGuard/releases/tag/v3.114.0. Consumer release verification passed for shipguard-v3.114.0.tar.gz with SHA-256 06b2cbaf0f499457b2790c6561574a4b8e067a6054d913807b176497f556079f. Post-release starter hygiene also moved initialized PLANS.md and SUBAGENTS.md to neutral templates/common files and validated package receipts.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.116.0 ShipGuard External Pilot Verdict Bench for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.116.0 ShipGuard External Pilot Verdict Bench for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the following /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.116.0 --title "ShipGuard External Pilot Verdict Bench" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private app source, paths, screenshots, app identifiers, or secrets.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.
