- Target release: v3.164.0
- Title: Plugin Skill Routing Actionability Fixture

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.164.0 Plugin Skill Routing Actionability Fixture for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Make value-gauntlet plugin/starter-skill routing questions promotion-ready and regression-covered so Codex-facing ShipGuard skill surfaces must be tied to actionable routing and validation commands.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.164.0 Plugin Skill Routing Actionability Fixture for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Make value-gauntlet plugin/starter-skill routing questions promotion-ready and regression-covered so Codex-facing ShipGuard skill surfaces must be tied to actionable routing and validation commands, push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Make value-gauntlet plugin/starter-skill routing questions promotion-ready and regression-covered so Codex-facing ShipGuard skill surfaces must be tied to actionable routing and validation commands.

## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: Updated report-quality candidate detection for plugin-skill, starter-skill, actionable-routing, and validation-command questions; promoted fixtures/ios-report-quality/plugin-skill-routing-value-gauntlet-question; wired focused report-quality assertions and package proof; and documented the ShipGuard-only loop refinement.
- Evidence: Passed: python3 -m py_compile scripts/ios_report_quality.py; python3 -m json.tool fixtures/ios-report-quality/plugin-skill-routing-value-gauntlet-question/fixture-candidate.json; python3 -m json.tool fixtures/ios-report-quality/plugin-skill-routing-value-gauntlet-question/fixture-report.json; ./bin/shipguard ios report-quality --reports fixtures/ios-report-quality/plugin-skill-routing-value-gauntlet-question --out /tmp/shipguard-plugin-skill-routing-fixture-quality --shareable; ./tests/ios_report_quality_test.sh; live value-gauntlet plus report-quality showed zero fixtureCandidates, five fixtureCoverage entries, and priorityAction moved to review-existing-fixture for the stable-publication fixture; git diff --check; ./bin/shipguard docs-check . --out /tmp/shipguard-v3164-docs-check; ./bin/shipguard validate; ./tests/package_release_test.sh.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.165.0 Stable Publication Fixture Review Loop for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.165.0 Stable Publication Fixture Review Loop for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the following /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.165.0 --title "Stable Publication Fixture Review Loop" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private app source, paths, screenshots, app identifiers, or secrets.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.164.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Create release `v3.164.0` and upload `dist/shipguard-v3.164.0.tar.gz`.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
