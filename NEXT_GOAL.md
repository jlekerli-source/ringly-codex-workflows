# Next Goal

- Current toolkit version: 3.38.0
- Target release: v3.47.0
- Title: Report-Quality Actionability Fixture Expansion

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.47.0 Report-Quality Actionability Fixture Expansion for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Aggregate input reportQualityQuestions in ios report-quality output and add a public actionability fixture so report-quality artifacts name the next ShipGuard rule, fixture, report section, or docs improvement instead of only generic next actions.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.47.0 Report-Quality Actionability Fixture Expansion for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Aggregate input reportQualityQuestions in ios report-quality output and add a public actionability fixture so report-quality artifacts name the next ShipGuard rule, fixture, report section, or docs improvement instead of only generic next actions, push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Aggregate input reportQualityQuestions in ios report-quality output and add a public actionability fixture so report-quality artifacts name the next ShipGuard rule, fixture, report section, or docs improvement instead of only generic next actions.

## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: Aggregate input reportQualityQuestions in ios report-quality output and add a public actionability fixture so report-quality artifacts name the next ShipGuard rule, fixture, report section, or docs improvement instead of only generic next actions.
- Evidence: Full read-only ShipGuard product-QA over Ringly and Ilmify showed source reports carried useful reportQualityQuestions, but ios report-quality ended with generic Next Actions only; after the change, Ringly and Ilmify shareable quality artifacts aggregate 21 Actionability Questions each, and the public fixtures/ios-report-quality/actionability case proves the section without private app code. Validated with python3 -m py_compile scripts/ios_report_quality.py; ./tests/ios_report_quality_test.sh; ./tests/ios_design_test.sh; ./tests/ios_shipguard_eval_test.sh; git diff --check; ./tests/cli_smoke_test.sh; ./tests/self_audit_test.sh; ./bin/shipguard validate; ./bin/shipguard docs-check . --out /tmp/shipguard-docs-check-v347; ./tests/package_release_test.sh; codex plugin marketplace add .; codex plugin add ios-shipguard@shipguard; ./bin/shipguard codex status --strict. Remote push remains blocked by GitHub repository rules: protected main cannot be updated directly and new branch creation is restricted.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.48.0 Performance Report Shareability Refinement for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.48.0 Performance Report Shareability Refinement for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the following /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.48.0 --title "Performance Report Shareability Refinement" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private Ringly, Ilmify, or other product source.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.47.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Create release `v3.47.0` and upload `dist/shipguard-v3.47.0.tar.gz`.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
