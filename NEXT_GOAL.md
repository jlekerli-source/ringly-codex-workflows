- Target release: v3.111.0
- Title: ShipGuard Performance Evidence Promotion Fixtures

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.111.0 ShipGuard Performance Evidence Promotion Fixtures for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Implement this bounded improvement: Add report-quality fixtures and checks that distinguish source-only iOS performance suspicion from measured runtime proof, promote findings only when same-route runtime or device evidence exists, and require one exact next action with owner, command or manual proof, expected artifact, success condition, and failure meaning.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.111.0 ShipGuard Performance Evidence Promotion Fixtures for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, deliver this bounded improvement: Add report-quality fixtures and checks that distinguish source-only iOS performance suspicion from measured runtime proof, promote findings only when same-route runtime or device evidence exists, and require one exact next action with owner, command or manual proof, expected artifact, success condition, and failure meaning, push main, verify GitHub Actions, publish the release tarball, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Bounded Scope

Add report-quality fixtures and checks that distinguish source-only iOS performance suspicion from measured runtime proof, promote findings only when same-route runtime or device evidence exists, and require one exact next action with owner, command or manual proof, expected artifact, success condition, and failure meaning.

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private app source, paths, screenshots, app identifiers, or secrets.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.111.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Create release `v3.111.0` and upload `dist/shipguard-v3.111.0.tar.gz`.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
