# Next Goal

- Generated: 2026-06-23T06:11:57Z
- Current toolkit version: 3.161.0
- Target release: v3.161.0
- Title: Diff-first recurring-signal tuning

## Version Lineage Check

- Status: pass
- VERSION: 3.161.0
- Expected next release from VERSION: v3.162.0
- Planned target release: v3.161.0
- Current checkout package artifact: dist/shipguard-v3.161.0.tar.gz
- Release package artifact to build: dist/shipguard-v3.161.0.tar.gz
- Action: VERSION already names v3.161.0; build, verify, publish, and consume dist/shipguard-v3.161.0.tar.gz before generating the next goal.

## Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.161.0 Diff-first recurring-signal tuning for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Pick exactly one high-signal maintainer reliability improvement from ROADMAP.md and write the bounded scope before editing.
2. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, and package proof needed for that improvement.
3. Run the required proof commands, treat blocked or timed-out commands as failures, and record exact blockers.
4. Push main, verify GitHub Actions, build and verify the release tarball, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then generate the following goal.
```

## Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.161.0 Diff-first recurring-signal tuning for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, finish one high-signal maintainer reliability improvement from ROADMAP.md with CLI/docs/tests/package proof, push main, verify GitHub Actions, build and verify the release tarball, publish and consume release proof, verify asset SHA-256 and clean git status, then run shipguard next-goal again for the following release.
```


## Completion Receipt

- Completed scope: v3.161 added recurring-signal tuning guidance to shipguard verify: diffLearningHandoff now includes recurringSignalTuning with signal keys, recurrence rule, candidate local metrics, do-not-tune-from-single-verdict flag, and proof boundary. Markdown renders track-recurring-signal guidance, and task-contract tests cover pass and blocked cases.
- Evidence: Commit a51a87ed713caab0661ae77c0c2f1e35c0663e14 pushed to main. Local proof passed: git diff --check; ./tests/task_contract_test.sh; ./tests/verify_first_quickstart_test.sh; ./bin/shipguard validate; ./bin/shipguard docs-check . --out /tmp/shipguard-docs-check-v3.161; ./tests/cli_smoke_test.sh; ./tests/self_audit_test.sh; ./tests/package_release_test.sh; env PREFIX="/Users/omarat-turkmani/.local" ./scripts/install.sh && ./bin/shipguard codex status --strict. GitHub Actions passed: https://github.com/jlekerli-source/ShipGuard/actions/runs/28005942449. Release proof built at /tmp/shipguard-v3.161.0-proof; public asset consumer proof passed at /tmp/shipguard-v3.161.0-consume; tarball SHA-256 89c8285facade9092f8ec7bf5775c1b08544d7c324704007538db74916819cc6 matched proof, asset copy, and dist/shipguard-v3.161.0.tar.gz. v4 release candidate passed at /tmp/shipguard-v3.161.0-candidate. Stable-publication remained honestly blocked with exit 1 at /tmp/shipguard-v3.161.0-stable-publication: status review until public GitHub release metadata exists.

## Following Slash Plan

```text
/plan v3.162.0 Diff-first reviewer disposition receipt for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard:
1. Review ROADMAP.md, docs/oss-evaluation.md, and the latest read-only ShipGuard product-QA evidence.
2. Pick one bounded improvement that makes ShipGuard reports more useful without turning private-app findings into app work.
3. Implement the CLI, docs, tests, package proof, and plugin-refresh proof needed for that improvement.
4. Generate the next completion receipt and following /plan plus /goal after validation passes.
```

## Following Slash Goal

```text
/goal Implement v3.162.0 Diff-first reviewer disposition receipt for jlekerli-source/ShipGuard: follow the /plan above, choose one bounded ShipGuard report-quality improvement from ROADMAP.md and docs/oss-evaluation.md, implement it with proof, and generate the next completion receipt plus following /plan and /goal after validation passes.
```

Generate that follow-up file with:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --release 3.162.0 --title "Diff-first reviewer disposition receipt" --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```

## Constraints

- Keep implementation dependency-light unless a dependency is clearly justified.
- Do not publish private app source, paths, screenshots, app identifiers, or secrets.
- Do not fake adoption, stars, downloads, benchmark results, or security findings.
- Prefer release-tarball proof over source-only proof.

## Release Loop

1. Open or update the tracking issue for v3.161.0.
2. Implement the smallest complete improvement that makes the toolkit more useful.
3. Update README, CLI docs, changelog, roadmap, and package verification.
4. Commit with an issue-closing reference.
5. Push `main` and verify GitHub Actions success.
6. Build `dist/shipguard-v3.161.0.tar.gz`, create release `v3.161.0`, upload the rebuilt tarball, and consume release proof.
7. Verify release asset digest, closed issue, tag target, and clean git status.
8. Generate the next goal:

```bash
./bin/shipguard next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md
```
