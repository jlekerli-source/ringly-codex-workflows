# Synthetic Report-Quality Fixture

## ShipGuard Evaluation Boundary

This is a public synthetic ShipGuard fixture. It is not copied from a private app report.

## Scan Scope

No private source tree was scanned. The fixture exists to exercise report-quality behavior.

## Fixture Intent

- Type: `shipguard-release-proof-quality-fixture`
- Source question: Does the stable-publication report prepare guarded launch relay drafts without posting, submitting, or bypassing explicit human approval?

## Evidence Packet

- Packet status: `pass`
- Required evidence passed: `9/9`
- First blocking gate: `none`

| Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `github-release-metadata` | `pass` |
| `release-notes` | `pass` |
| `launchkey-candidate-packet` | `pass` |
| `downloaded-release-assets` | `pass` |
| `post-release-consumer-proof` | `pass` |
| `release-version-coherence` | `pass` |
| `release-asset-coherence` | `pass` |
| `independent-adoption-evidence` | `pass` |
| `final-security-review-evidence` | `pass` |

## Public Evidence Closure

- Status: `pass`
- Starter kit: `stable-publication-evidence-kit`
- Real adoption evidence required: `True`
- Final security review required: `True`
- GitHub download counts count as adoption evidence: `False`
- Fixture evidence counts as stable-v4 evidence: `False`
- Marketplace acceptance claimed: `False`

| Evidence | Gate | Freshness | Eligible | Fresh | Stale | Starter |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `independent-adoption-evidence` | `pass` | `pass` | `1` | `1` | `0` | `stable-publication-evidence-kit/external-adoption-evidence.json` |
| `final-security-review-evidence` | `pass` | `pass` | `1` | `1` | `0` | `stable-publication-evidence-kit/security-review-evidence.json` |

Copy-ready commands:

- `cp templates/stable-publication/external-adoption-evidence.template.json <evidence-dir>/external-adoption-evidence.json`
- `cp templates/stable-publication/security-review-evidence.template.json <evidence-dir>/security-review-evidence.json`
- `./bin/shipguard v4 stable-publication --path . --out <stable-publication-dir> --shipguard-eval --shareable`

Public evidence non-claims:

- GitHub stars, forks, or download counts are not independent adoption evidence.
- Fixture adoption or security records prove the tool path only.
- Security-review evidence does not imply marketplace acceptance.
- Private app evidence must stay redacted before shareable publication proof.

## External Evidence Intake Checklist

| Evidence | Accepted classes | Required fields | Redaction boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `independent-adoption-evidence` | public-external, private-redacted-external | actorRelationship, privateDataRedacted, commands, artifacts, outcome, nonClaims | privateDataRedacted must be `True` |
| `final-security-review-evidence` | public-security-review, private-redacted-security-review | scope, methodology, findingsSummary, privateDataRedacted, nonClaims | privateDataRedacted must be `True` |

- Severity threshold: `criticalOpen=0`, `highOpen=0`
- Required evidence fields: reviewerRelationship, scope, methodology, commands, artifacts, findingsSummary, nonClaims
- Redaction boundaries: privateDataRedacted must be true, no private app source, no private app identifiers, no local absolute paths, no screenshots with private data, no tokens or account identifiers

- Missing topics: `none`

| Evidence class | Status | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public-consumer-proof` | `can-be-produced-by-maintainer` | Install and verify ShipGuard from public release assets only; this proves public consumability, not adoption. |
| `private-maintainer-qa` | `useful-but-not-adoption` | Ringly, Ilmify, or other maintainer app runs may expose ShipGuard product gaps, but they do not satisfy independent adoption evidence. |
| `independent-adoption-evidence` | `requires-external-actor` | A non-maintainer user, repo, issue, PR, or redacted external install report must supply the adoption record. |
| `final-security-review-evidence` | `requires-review-record` | A security review record must cover the required ShipGuard surfaces and show no open critical or high findings. |
