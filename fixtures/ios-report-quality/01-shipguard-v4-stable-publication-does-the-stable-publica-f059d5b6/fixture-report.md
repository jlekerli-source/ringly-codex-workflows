# Synthetic Report-Quality Fixture

## ShipGuard Evaluation Boundary

This is a public synthetic ShipGuard fixture. It is not copied from a private app report.

## Scan Scope

No private source tree was scanned. The fixture exists to exercise report-quality behavior.

## Fixture Intent

- Type: `shipguard-release-proof-quality-fixture`
- Source question: Does the stable-publication report prepare guarded launch relay drafts without posting, submitting, or bypassing explicit human approval?

## Evidence Packet

- Packet status: `pass`
- Required evidence passed: `8/8`
- First blocking gate: `none`

| Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `github-release-metadata` | `pass` |
| `release-notes` | `pass` |
| `launchkey-candidate-packet` | `pass` |
| `downloaded-release-assets` | `pass` |
| `post-release-consumer-proof` | `pass` |
| `release-version-coherence` | `pass` |
| `independent-adoption-evidence` | `pass` |
| `final-security-review-evidence` | `pass` |

## External Evidence Freshness

| Evidence | Status | Reference timestamp | Fresh stable records | Stale stable records |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `independent-adoption-evidence` | `pass` | `2026-06-20T00:00:00Z` | `1` | `0` |
| `final-security-review-evidence` | `pass` | `2026-06-20T00:00:00Z` | `1` | `0` |

Freshness boundary:

- `independent-adoption-evidence` generatedAt no earlier than release manifest: `True`
- `independent-adoption-evidence` first problem: none
- `final-security-review-evidence` generatedAt no earlier than release manifest: `True`
- `final-security-review-evidence` first problem: none

## Release Version Coherence

- Status: `pass`
- Source VERSION: `0.0.0`
- Release version: `0.0.0`
- Expected tag: `v0.0.0`
- GitHub returned tag: `v0.0.0`
- Manifest version: `0.0.0`
- Package version: `0.0.0`
- Consumer report version: `0.0.0`
- Expected tarball: `shipguard-v0.0.0.tar.gz`
- Manifest artifact: `shipguard-v0.0.0.tar.gz`
- Source-only proof counts as version coherence proof: `False`

| Version comparison | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `sourceVersionMatchesRequested` | `True` |
| `metadataReturnedTagMatchesRequested` | `True` |
| `manifestVersionMatchesRequested` | `True` |
| `packageVersionMatchesRequested` | `True` |
| `consumerReportVersionMatchesRequested` | `True` |

Version coherence problems:

- none

## Closure Checklist

- Checklist status: `pass`
- Remaining blockers: `0`
- No hidden lower-order blockers: `True`

| Rank | Evidence | Status | First | Next command | Proof boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | `none` | `pass` | `False` | `not-needed` | Every stable-publication gate passed. |

## Evidence Templates

- Draft-only templates: `True`

| Template | Exists | Copy command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `independent-adoption-evidence` | `True` | `cp templates/stable-publication/external-adoption-evidence.template.json <evidence-dir>/external-adoption-evidence.json` |
| `final-security-review-evidence` | `True` | `cp templates/stable-publication/security-review-evidence.template.json <evidence-dir>/security-review-evidence.json` |

## Launch Relay Drafts

Approval boundary:

Public posting, publishing, submission, or account-visible external actions require explicit human approval for that exact launch run.
