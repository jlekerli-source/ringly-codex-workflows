# Synthetic Report-Quality Fixture

## ShipGuard Evaluation Boundary

This is a public synthetic ShipGuard fixture. It is not copied from a private app report.

## Scan Scope

No private source tree was scanned. The fixture exists to exercise report-quality behavior.

## Fixture Intent

- Type: `shipguard-release-proof-quality-fixture`
- Source question: Does the stable-publication report block every stable-v4 claim until independent adoption and final security evidence are attached?

## Stable Publication Evidence Packet

- Status: `blocked`
- Stable v4 release: `false`
- First blocking gate: `independent-adoption-evidence`
- Next command: `./bin/shipguard v4 stable-publication --path . --out <dir> --github-release-repo <owner/repo> --release-version <version> --release-candidate-report <candidate-report> --download-release-assets --external-adoption-evidence <evidence.json> --security-review-evidence <security.json> --shipguard-eval --shareable`
- Non-claim: this fixture proves report-quality behavior only.

## Closure Checklist

- Checklist status: `review`
- Remaining blockers: `2`
- No hidden lower-order blockers: `True`

| Rank | Evidence | Status | First | Next command | Proof boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `independent-adoption-evidence` | `not-provided` | `True` | `./bin/shipguard v4 stable-publication --path . --out <dir> --external-adoption-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> --security-review-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> --shipguard-eval --shareable` | Independent public adoption evidence must pass structure, redaction, and independence checks; fixture evidence is not enough. |
| `2` | `final-security-review-evidence` | `not-provided` | `False` | `./bin/shipguard v4 stable-publication --path . --out <dir> --external-adoption-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> --security-review-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> --shipguard-eval --shareable` | Final security review evidence must cover CLI, plugin, GitHub Actions, release proof, package install, and redaction/privacy with no open critical or high findings. |

Pass criteria:

- At least one JSON record has status=pass.
- evidenceType is shipguard-external-adoption.

- fixtureSynthetic is true.
- Evidence relies only on GitHub downloads or maintainer-only runs.
- The record contains local paths, private app identifiers, screenshots with private data, tokens, or account data.

Rerun after attaching real evidence:

```bash
./bin/shipguard v4 stable-publication --path . --out <dir> --external-adoption-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> --security-review-evidence <evidence-json-or-dir> --shipguard-eval --shareable

| Evidence class | Status | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public-consumer-proof` | `can-be-produced-by-maintainer` | Install and verify ShipGuard from public release assets only; this proves public consumability, not adoption. |
| `private-maintainer-qa` | `useful-but-not-adoption` | Ringly, Ilmify, or other maintainer app runs may expose ShipGuard product gaps, but they do not satisfy independent adoption evidence. |
| `independent-adoption-evidence` | `requires-external-actor` | A non-maintainer user, repo, issue, PR, or redacted external install report must supply the adoption record. |
| `final-security-review-evidence` | `requires-review-record` | A security review record must cover the required ShipGuard surfaces and show no open critical or high findings. |
