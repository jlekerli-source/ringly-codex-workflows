ShipGuard helps you use Codex and other coding agents without accepting vague handoffs like "done", "tested", or "should work".

It gives every task a simple loop:

```text
scope the work -> collect proof -> check the claims -> review or block
```

ShipGuard is open source, local-first, and app-neutral. It works as a CLI today, with deeper Codex and iOS support where proof needs to be especially concrete.

## Why ShipGuard Exists

AI agents can make useful code changes quickly. The hard part is knowing whether the work is actually safe to review.

ShipGuard checks the parts that usually get hand-waved:

- What was the task supposed to touch?
- Which files changed?
- Were risky or protected files touched?
- Did tests or runtime checks actually run?
- Are the agent's claims supported by evidence?
- What should the maintainer do next?

The output is a Markdown and JSON report you can read, attach to a PR, or archive as release proof.

## Install

From a ShipGuard checkout or release package:

```bash
PREFIX="$HOME/.local" ./scripts/install.sh
shipguard version
shipguard validate
```

Add ShipGuard starter files to a project:

```bash
shipguard init ios .
shipguard doctor ios .
```

Starter profiles are available for `ios`, `web`, `backend`, and `cli`.

## Try It In 3 Minutes

Run the built-in proof demo from this repository:

```bash
./bin/shipguard prepare \
  "Add notification permission copy" \
  --path fixtures/demo-ios-repo \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-task \
  --profile ios \
  --validation "swift test" \
  --shareable

./bin/shipguard verify \
  --task /tmp/shipguard-task/shipguard-task.json \
  --diff examples/verify-first/diffs/scoped-permission.diff \
  --evidence examples/verify-first/receipts/swift-test-receipt.json \
  --claim "Implemented scoped notification permission copy." \
  --out /tmp/shipguard-verdict
```

Open:

```bash
/tmp/shipguard-verdict/shipguard-verdict.md
```

You should see a verdict like:

```text
ShipGuard Proof Report
Status: pass
Validation: covered
Claims checked: accepted
Next action: review or merge with the attached proof
```

For more examples, see [Verify-First Quickstart](docs/verify-first-quickstart.md).

## Daily Commands

Most users only need these:

| Command | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `shipguard init <profile> <repo>` | Add ShipGuard workflow files to a project. |
| `shipguard doctor <profile> <repo>` | Check whether the workflow files are present. |
| `shipguard prepare ...` | Create a scoped task contract before agent work. |
| `shipguard verify ...` | Check a diff, evidence, and claims after agent work. |
| `shipguard lean audit ...` | Find code that may not need to exist, with proof-required safety boundaries. |
| `shipguard docs-check ...` | Find broken local Markdown links. |
| `shipguard full-audit ...` | Run a broader ShipGuard maintainer audit. |

Common flow:

```bash
shipguard prepare "Fix the checkout empty state" --path . --out /tmp/task --profile ios
shipguard verify --task /tmp/task/shipguard-task.json --diff /tmp/change.diff --evidence /tmp/test-receipt.json --out /tmp/verdict
```

## iOS And Codex

ShipGuard has first-class iOS and Codex support:

```bash
shipguard ios design --path . --out /tmp/ios-design --icon-brief
shipguard ios performance --path . --out /tmp/ios-performance
shipguard ios modernize --focus swift --path . --out /tmp/ios-modernize
shipguard ios report-quality --reports /tmp/ios-design --out /tmp/report-quality
```

Useful iOS surfaces:

- `ios design`: UI, motion, haptics, app type, design DNA, and icon brief guidance.
- `ios performance`: source-level performance risk report.
- `ios preview`: phone-shaped simulator preview for visual review.
- `ios devspace`: ChatGPT/Codex visual planning bridge for the preview.
- `ios report-quality`: checks whether ShipGuard reports are actually useful.

Refresh the local Codex plugin while developing ShipGuard:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add .
codex plugin add ios-shipguard@shipguard
shipguard codex status --strict
```

Start a new Codex thread after refreshing the plugin so the latest skill text is loaded.

## GitHub Action

ShipGuard can run in CI and attach proof reports to pull requests.

Start here:

## ShipYard

ShipGuard is the product. ShipYard is the maintainer layer around it: fixtures, evals, release proof, marketplace checks, report-quality tests, and product QA.

That split matters:

- ShipGuard is what developers install and run.
- ShipYard is how contributors keep ShipGuard honest.
