# ShipGuard

ShipGuard is a local-first workflow kit for using Codex on production iOS apps without losing control of scope, proof, or release risk.

It gives AI-assisted development a repeatable operating loop:

- Map risky surfaces before editing: permissions, notifications, StoreKit, widgets, App Intents, background modes, performance, design, and release proof.
- Generate plans, specs, tasks, slash goals, and validation commands before implementation.
- Run read-only product-QA reports against real apps without turning findings into accidental app work.
- Score report quality, redact/share safely, and package release evidence.

ShipGuard is not tied to any single app. This repo ships reusable CLI commands, Codex skills, plugin metadata, fixtures, tests, and GitHub Actions for developers who want agent work to be reviewable instead of vague.

## Who This Is For

- Solo developers and small teams using Codex on production apps.
- iOS developers working near permissions, notifications, subscriptions, widgets, App Intents, performance, design, or release gates.
- Maintainers who want agents to plan, test, hand off, and prove work before shipping.

## Quick Start

Install from a release tarball, then validate the bundle:

```bash
tar -xzf shipguard-v3.59.0.tar.gz
cd shipguard-v3.59.0
PREFIX="$HOME/.local" ./scripts/install.sh
"$HOME/.local/bin/shipguard" version
./bin/shipguard validate
```

Copy a starter workflow into your app:

```bash
./bin/shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard init web ../my-web-app
```

1. Start each non-trivial Codex thread from `CODEX_TASK_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Copy `AGENTS.md` into your repo root and replace the sample project names, paths, commands, and protected areas with your own.
3. Use `PLANS.md` before risky work, release work, or changes that touch persistence, notifications, payments, or app lifecycle code.
4. Pick the relevant skill under `.agents/skills/` and paste it into your Codex task context.
5. Run the narrowest validation lane that proves the change.
6. Record blockers and proof honestly before merging or shipping.

Start with these docs:

- `docs/adoption-guide.md`: first 30 minutes with ShipGuard.
- `docs/command-matrix.md`: map maintainer jobs to CLI commands.
- `docs/ios-shipguard.md`: iOS plugin, skill, and CLI workflow.
- `docs/shipguard-devspace.md`: ChatGPT visual-planning bridge from the iPhone preview.
- `docs/oss-evaluation.md`: how read-only app evidence becomes ShipGuard product improvements.
- `docs/security-threat-model.md`: trust boundaries for local CLI, plugin, Devspace, GitHub, and release proof.
- `docs/index.md`: full documentation map.

Common loops:

| Job | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Audit an AI coding run | `./bin/shipguard autopsy --help` |
| Inspect risky iOS surfaces | `./bin/shipguard ios doctor --help` |
| Review iOS performance evidence | `./bin/shipguard ios performance --help` |
| Review UI/UX, motion, haptics, and icon direction | `./bin/shipguard ios design --help` |
| Grade ShipGuard report usefulness | `./bin/shipguard ios report-quality --help` |
| Generate governed spec/plan/task artifacts | `./bin/shipguard ios spec-workflow --help` |
| Prepare release proof | `./bin/shipguard release-proof --help` |
| Check docs-heavy changes | `./bin/shipguard docs-check --help` |
| Create the next improvement handoff | `./bin/shipguard next-goal --help` |

Read `docs/cli.md` for the full command reference and `examples/demo-walkthrough.md` for a complete public proof path.

## What Is Inside

- `bin/shipguard`: the local CLI for validation, iOS analysis, report quality, spec workflow generation, release proof, and handoff creation.
- `plugins/ios-shipguard/`: the Codex plugin bundle for the iOS ShipGuard skill and metadata.
- `.agents/skills/`: reusable skill templates for risky app maintenance workflows.
- `templates/`: starter profiles for adapting ShipGuard into another app.
- `docs/`: command reference, adoption guide, iOS workflow docs, Devspace docs, security model, and release-proof docs.
- `examples/` and `fixtures/`: public demo runs, benchmark fixtures, and regression cases used to prove behavior without private app code.
- `actions/`: reusable GitHub Actions for validation, report comparison, transcript checks, and release evidence.
- `evals/`: deterministic behavior checks for the ShipGuard workflow itself.

## Workflow Map

```text
request
  -> read AGENTS.md
  -> choose risk lane
  -> write or update PLANS.md
  -> make the smallest scoped change
  -> run the narrowest proof command
  -> review the diff and evidence
  -> ship only what is proven
```

## Why This Matters

AI coding agents are strongest when the project gives them structure: narrow scopes, explicit guardrails, real validation, and clear handoffs when proof is missing.

This repository turns those habits into public templates that developers can adapt to their own production apps without inheriting private-product assumptions.

## Current Status

This is an early public workflow kit. The next priorities are documented in `ROADMAP.md`, and contribution guidance lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

The repository is also configured as a GitHub template, so you can start from it directly and then replace the sample project profile with your own app's workflow.
