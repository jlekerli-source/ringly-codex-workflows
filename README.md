  Local-first CLI + Codex plugin for proof-gated app maintenance.
</p>

ShipGuard is a local-first workflow kit for using Codex on production apps without losing control of scope, proof, or release risk.

It gives AI-assisted development a repeatable operating loop:

- Map risky surfaces before editing: build/run/debug routes, permissions, notifications, StoreKit, widgets, App Intents, background modes, performance, design, and release proof.
- Prepare one durable task contract before Codex edits, then verify the exact diff, evidence, and claims after Codex works.
- Generate plans, specs, tasks, slash goals, and validation commands before implementation.
- Run read-only product-QA reports against real apps without turning findings into accidental app work.
- Score report quality, redact/share safely, promote public-safe fixtures, and package release evidence.

ShipGuard is not tied to any single app. This repo is the ShipGuard ShipYard: the workshop for reusable CLI commands, Codex skills, plugin metadata, fixtures, tests, and GitHub Actions for developers who want agent work to be reviewable instead of vague.

Latest published release: `v3.131.0`. That release adds ShipGuard V4 Release Candidate Readiness / LaunchKey: fresh install, package-tarball fresh-install proof, upgrade, uninstall, release-proof consumption, external adoption packet, final schema docs, plugin refresh proof, release-readiness commands, and blocked stable-v4 claims. Active ShipYard work on `main` now hardens LaunchKey with final security-review evidence gating, external adoption evidence gating, native GitHub release-asset download, published-release asset proof, fresh-install receipts, same-prefix upgrade receipts, rollback cleanup receipts, generated archive-member screening, blocking-proof result UX, report-quality exclusion for generated proof directories, Full Audit release-packet plan honesty, NEXT_GOAL-backed Full Audit slash handoffs, and Tool Value Gauntlet product-release stabilization receipts; those prove the fixture-backed release packet path, not a stable-v4 claim. The remaining stable-v4 gap is real public release publication proof from downloaded GitHub assets plus independent adoption/security evidence.

The naming style is intentional: stable commands and paths stay literal, while product surfaces get branded names like ShipGuard StarterBay, ShipGuard LaunchDeck, ShipGuard PulseRadar, ShipGuard VibeCheck, ShipGuard Tool Value Gauntlet, ShipGuard Full Audit, ShipGuard InspectDeck, ShipGuard PilotBench, ShipGuard TraceBridge, ShipGuard ReleaseDock, ShipGuard PluginRadar, and ShipGuard NextRail. The nitty-gritty gets call signs too: Deckhand Scripts, Gauntlet Runs, Blackbox Receipts, Bridge Notes, Engine Tapes, Cargo Crates, and Docking Gear. See `docs/shipguard-naming.md` or run `./bin/shipguard brand --strict` before adding new surfaces.

## Who This Is For

- Solo developers and small teams using Codex on production apps.
- iOS developers working near permissions, notifications, subscriptions, widgets, App Intents, performance, design, or release gates.
- Maintainers who want agents to plan, test, hand off, and prove work before shipping.

## Quick Start

Install from a release tarball, then validate the bundle:

```bash
tar -xzf shipguard-v3.131.0.tar.gz
cd shipguard-v3.131.0
PREFIX="$HOME/.local" ./scripts/install.sh
"$HOME/.local/bin/shipguard" version
./bin/shipguard validate
```

When you are inside your own app repo, use the installed command instead of `./bin/shipguard`:

```bash
shipguard ios inventory --path . --out /tmp/ios-shipguard-inventory
# or, if ~/.local/bin is not on PATH:
"$HOME/.local/bin/shipguard" ios inventory --path . --out /tmp/ios-shipguard-inventory
```

Copy a starter workflow into your app:

```bash
./bin/shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app
./bin/shipguard init web ../my-web-app
./bin/shipguard web audit --path ../my-web-app --out /tmp/shipguard-web-audit --shareable
./bin/shipguard backend audit --path ../my-service --out /tmp/shipguard-backend-audit --shareable
./bin/shipguard cli audit --path ../my-tool --out /tmp/shipguard-cli-audit --shareable
```

For a risky change, start with the proof-gated task loop:

```bash
./bin/shipguard prepare "Add provisional notification onboarding flow" --path ../my-ios-app --out /tmp/shipguard-task --profile ios --shareable
# after Codex edits
./bin/shipguard verify --task /tmp/shipguard-task/shipguard-task.json --diff /tmp/change.diff --evidence /tmp/validation-receipt.json --out /tmp/shipguard-verdict
```

1. Initialize the repo with `shipguard init <profile> <target>`.
2. Replace the generated `AGENTS.md` placeholders with real project names, paths, commands, and protected areas.
3. Use the generated `PLANS.md` before risky work, release work, or changes that touch persistence, notifications, payments, migrations, or app lifecycle code.
4. Pick the relevant skill under `.agents/skills/` and paste it into your Codex task context.
5. Run the narrowest validation lane that proves the change.
6. Record blockers and proof honestly before merging or shipping.

- `scripts/full_audit.py`: ShipGuard Full Audit, the resumable ShipYard proof lane for validation, value-gauntlet, report-quality, package, plugin, CI, and release-proof preparation, with a compact result block, copy-ready execution-command table, and NEXT_GOAL-backed slash handoff at the top.
- `scripts/shipguard_inspect.py`: ShipGuard InspectDeck, the one-surface proof-state report for repo state, value-gauntlet proof, full-audit proof, Codex plugin status, release proof, underlying evidence, result verdict, and exact next action.
- `scripts/external_pilot_verdict_bench.py`: ShipGuard PilotBench for scoring public-safe read-only task traces across owner detection, scope, proof, claims, redaction, next action, false positives, and first useful verdict time.
- `scripts/agent_trace.py`: ShipGuard TraceBridge for normalizing agent/Codex traces into prompt, tool, receipt, verdict, next-action, verify-handoff, runtime-receipt, and worker-budget evidence.
- `scripts/profile_audit.py`: ShipGuard WebScan, ServiceRadar, and CommandLens first-audit reports for web, backend, and CLI starter targets, with scan transparency that excludes generated ShipGuard starter files from target evidence.
- `scripts/profile_fix_plan.py`: ShipGuard WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge fix-plan reports that turn profile audits into scoped tasks, validation commands, read-only validation receipts, validation rerun receipts, stop conditions, and report-quality questions.

- `evals/`: deterministic behavior checks for the ShipGuard workflow itself.

## Workflow Map

```text
request
  -> read AGENTS.md
  -> choose risk lane
  -> prepare a ShipGuard task contract
  -> write or update PLANS.md
  -> make the smallest scoped change
  -> run the narrowest proof command
  -> verify the diff, evidence, and claims
  -> ship only what is proven
```

## Why This Matters

AI coding agents are strongest when the project gives them structure: narrow scopes, explicit guardrails, real validation, and clear handoffs when proof is missing.

This repository turns those habits into public templates that developers can adapt to their own production apps without inheriting private-product assumptions.

## Current Status

This is an early public workflow kit with a published `v3.131.0` release train and active v4 stabilization work in the ShipYard. The focused product direction is documented in `docs/product-strategy.md`: ShipGuard should become the local policy, context, and evidence layer for high-risk Codex changes, starting with production iOS apps and expanding through app-neutral task, proof, release, and report-quality workflows. The next priorities are documented in `ROADMAP.md`, and contribution guidance lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

The repository is also configured as a GitHub template, so you can start from it directly and then replace the sample project profile with your own app's workflow.

## Open Source

ShipGuard is MIT licensed and built in public as a local-first developer tool. The public repo should contain the CLI, plugin metadata, skills, docs, fixtures, evals, examples, tests, and release proof needed to trust the tool without private app code.

Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution workflow, `SUPPORT.md` for issue routing, `GOVERNANCE.md` for maintainer boundaries, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community behavior, and `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability or unsafe-disclosure handling. The native rule is: learn from mature open-source tools, but convert every idea into ShipGuard's own proof, report-quality, redaction, and local-first model.
