# Ringly Codex Workflows

Public operating rules for using Codex on risk-sensitive solo iOS work.

This repository shares the workflow layer I use around Ringly, an iPhone alarm app where reliability, notification truth, StoreKit behavior, and release proof matter. It does not contain private Ringly source code. It contains the reusable process: agent instructions, planning templates, validation routing, skill prompts, release checklists, and evaluation tasks.

The goal is simple: make AI-assisted coding repeatable, reviewable, and useful for real product maintenance.

## Who This Is For

- Solo developers using Codex or similar coding agents on production apps.
- iOS developers working near alarms, notifications, widgets, subscriptions, or release gates.
- Maintainers who want agents to plan, test, and hand off work with evidence instead of vague claims.

## Quick Start

Install from a release tarball:

```bash
tar -xzf codex-maintainer-v0.6.0.tar.gz
cd codex-maintainer-v0.6.0
PREFIX="$HOME/.local" ./scripts/install.sh
"$HOME/.local/bin/codex-maintainer" version
```

Read the guided setup first:

- `docs/adoption-guide.md`: first 30 minutes with the workflow kit.
- `docs/arena.md`: benchmark runner for multiple maintainer fixtures.
- `docs/autopsy.md`: evidence checks for AI coding runs.
- `docs/autopsy-github-actions.md`: upload autopsy reports as GitHub Actions artifacts.
- `docs/benchmark.md`: stable public benchmark and leaderboard format.
- `docs/ci-gate.md`: CI gate command and GitHub Action for policy enforcement.
- `docs/command-matrix.md`: one-page map from maintainer jobs to CLI commands.
- `docs/demo-reports.md`: checked-in demo reports generated from public fixtures.
- `docs/maintainer-reliability-os.md`: the full policy-to-self-audit evidence loop.
- `docs/next-goal.md`: generate the next slash-goal release plan.
- `docs/policy.md`: configure protected paths, risky claims, and scope limits.
- `docs/pr-review-bot.md`: generate PR-ready review comments and badge JSON from autopsy reports.
- `docs/release-checklist.md`: release proof commands and publishing checks.
- `docs/use-in-your-repo.md`: copy/paste setup for another repository.
- `docs/workflow-diagram.md`: visual workflow map.
- `docs/index.md`: GitHub Pages-ready documentation landing page.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: release history.
- `CODEX_TASK_TEMPLATE.md`: pasteable task contracts for new Codex threads.

Validate this workflow bundle:

```bash
./bin/codex-maintainer validate
```

Copy the iOS starter into another project:

```bash
./bin/codex-maintainer init ios ../my-ios-app
```

1. Start each non-trivial Codex thread from `CODEX_TASK_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Copy `AGENTS.md` into your repo root and replace the Ringly-specific paths with your project paths.
3. Use `PLANS.md` before risky work, release work, or changes that touch persistence, notifications, payments, or app lifecycle code.
4. Pick the relevant skill under `.agents/skills/` and paste it into your Codex task context.
5. Run the narrowest validation lane that proves the change.
6. Record blockers and proof honestly before merging or shipping.

For a worked example, read `examples/issue-to-plan-to-validation.md`.
For public proof without private app code, read `examples/demo-walkthrough.md`.
For agent-claim auditing, run `./bin/codex-maintainer autopsy` against `fixtures/autopsy/`.
For aggregate benchmark proof, run `./bin/codex-maintainer arena run --fixture fixtures/arena --out /tmp/arena`.
For toolkit release readiness, run `./bin/codex-maintainer self-audit --out /tmp/codex-maintainer-audit`.
For the next improvement loop, run `./bin/codex-maintainer next-goal --out NEXT_GOAL.md`.

## Workflow Map

```text
request
  -> read AGENTS.md
  -> choose risk lane
  -> write or update PLANS.md
  -> make the smallest scoped change
  -> run the narrowest proof command
  -> review the diff and evidence
  -> ship only what is proven
```

## Why This Matters

AI coding agents are strongest when the project gives them structure. Ringly is my live test bed for that structure: narrow scopes, explicit guardrails, real validation, and clear handoffs when proof is missing.

This repository turns those habits into public templates that other developers can adapt without copying the private app.

## Current Status

This is an early public workflow kit. The next priorities are documented in `ROADMAP.md`, and contribution guidance lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

The repository is also configured as a GitHub template, so you can start from it directly and then remove the Ringly-specific examples you do not need.
