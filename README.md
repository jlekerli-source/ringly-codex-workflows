# ShipGuard

ShipGuard is a Codex workflow kit for risk-sensitive solo iOS maintenance.

It packages the operating layer I use around Ringly, an iPhone alarm app where reliability, notification truth, StoreKit behavior, and release proof matter. It does not contain private Ringly source code. It contains the reusable process: agent instructions, planning templates, validation routing, skill prompts, release checklists, GitHub Actions, and evaluation tasks that make Codex work auditable instead of vague.

The goal is simple: make AI-assisted coding repeatable, reviewable, and useful for real product maintenance.

## Who This Is For

- Solo developers using Codex or similar coding agents on production apps.
- iOS developers working near alarms, notifications, widgets, subscriptions, or release gates.
- Maintainers who want agents to plan, test, and hand off work with evidence instead of vague claims.

## Quick Start

Install from a release tarball:

```bash
tar -xzf shipguard-v3.38.0.tar.gz
cd shipguard-v3.38.0
PREFIX="$HOME/.local" ./scripts/install.sh

Validate this workflow bundle:

```bash
./bin/shipguard validate
```

Copy the iOS starter into another project:

```bash
./bin/shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app
```

Copy the web starter into another project:

```bash
./bin/shipguard init web ../my-web-app
```

1. Start each non-trivial Codex thread from `CODEX_TASK_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Copy `AGENTS.md` into your repo root and replace the Ringly-specific paths with your project paths.
3. Use `PLANS.md` before risky work, release work, or changes that touch persistence, notifications, payments, or app lifecycle code.
4. Pick the relevant skill under `.agents/skills/` and paste it into your Codex task context.
5. Run the narrowest validation lane that proves the change.
6. Record blockers and proof honestly before merging or shipping.

For a worked example, read `examples/issue-to-plan-to-validation.md`.

## Workflow Map

```text
request
  -> read AGENTS.md
  -> choose risk lane
  -> write or update PLANS.md
  -> make the smallest scoped change
  -> run the narrowest proof command
  -> review the diff and evidence
  -> ship only what is proven
```

## Why This Matters

AI coding agents are strongest when the project gives them structure. Ringly is my live test bed for that structure: narrow scopes, explicit guardrails, real validation, and clear handoffs when proof is missing.

This repository turns those habits into public templates that other developers can adapt without copying the private app.

## Current Status

This is an early public workflow kit. The next priorities are documented in `ROADMAP.md`, and contribution guidance lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

The repository is also configured as a GitHub template, so you can start from it directly and then remove the Ringly-specific examples you do not need.
