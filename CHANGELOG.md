# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/design-coherence-boundary` coverage after read-only product-QA showed the next uncovered design question was boundary separation: `shipguard ios design` reports now expose `designCoherenceBoundary` with separate source inventory, coherence risks, ShipGuard next action, app-work authorization, proof boundary, and `targetRemediationStatus: not-authorized-from-this-run`.
- Tightened `shipguard ios report-quality` so ShipGuard-evaluation design reports missing the coherence boundary, separation checks, ShipGuard-owned next action, app-work authorization status, proof boundary, or Markdown rendering receive review findings; regenerated read-only Ringly/Ilmify product-QA output now has fixture coverage for runtime boundary, grouped performance, evidence promotion, app-type tailoring, and design coherence boundaries.
- Added public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/design-app-type-tailoring` coverage after read-only product-QA showed the next uncovered design question was app-type tailoring: `shipguard ios design` reports now expose a machine-readable `designTailoring` contract with source signals, guidance profile, tailored motion/haptics/visual-density/copy dimensions, and one exact next proof action.
- Tightened `shipguard ios report-quality` so design reports missing the app-type tailoring contract, source signals, tailored dimensions, Markdown rendering, or next-action proof fields receive review findings; regenerated read-only Ringly/Ilmify product-QA output now has fixture coverage for runtime boundary, grouped performance, evidence promotion, and design app-type tailoring, moving the next priority to design-system coherence boundary separation.
- Added public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/performance-evidence-promotion` coverage after read-only product-QA showed the next uncovered performance question was promotion evidence: source-only suspicions now need a machine-readable next action before they become broader work.
- Added `evidencePromotion` to `shipguard ios performance` JSON and Markdown: reports now name source evidence, promotion status, first candidate rule, required proof, and one exact next action with owner, manual proof, expected artifact, success condition, and failure meaning.
- Tightened `shipguard ios report-quality` so non-pass performance reports missing the evidence-promotion next-action contract receive review findings; regenerated read-only Ringly/Ilmify product-QA output now has fixture coverage for runtime boundary, grouped performance, and evidence promotion, moving the next priority to design app-type tailoring.
- Added public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/grouped-performance-observation` coverage after read-only product-QA showed grouped performance fixture candidates were too generic; the fixture uses synthetic `swiftui-repeat-forever-animation` findings and keeps private app evidence out of public files.
- Upgraded `shipguard ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates` so generated `ios-performance-report-quality-fixture` reports include repeated synthetic findings, `ruleSummary`, `groupedActionPlan`, `firstExperiment`, `validationRoute`, `stopCondition`, Markdown `Grouped Next Actions`, and split local/manual proof boundaries before promotion.
- Regenerated the read-only performance/design product-QA loop and proved fixture coverage now suppresses both runtime-boundary and grouped-performance questions, moving the next uncovered priority to performance evidence promotion.
- Added the `runtimeEvidenceBoundary` contract to `shipguard ios performance`: source-only performance reports now state `evidence: source heuristic`, `confidence: medium`, `runtimeProof: missing`, and `blocking: no` in JSON and Markdown so PulseRadar cannot imply CPU/GPU/FPS proof without a matching trace or physical-device evidence.
- Tightened `shipguard ios report-quality` so performance reports missing that runtime-proof boundary receive a review finding, promoted a public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/performance-runtime-boundary` fixture for the repeated read-only product-QA boundary question, and proved regenerated Ringly/Ilmify read-only reports score 100/100 while moving the next uncovered priority to grouped performance fixture work.
- Upgraded `shipguard ios doctor` / ShipGuard DockCheck after read-only Ringly and Ilmify product-QA: doctor reports now emit `schemaVersion`, `generatedAt`, privacy-safe `<target-repo>` roots, target metadata, and structured finding fields (`ruleId`, `evidence`, `recommendation`, `proofGuidance`) so `ios report-quality --shareable` can grade DockCheck output at 100/100 without leaking local paths.
- Added the proof-gated task contract core: `shipguard prepare` writes one durable task object with repo context, risk, authorized files, protected boundaries, validation contract, claims, and next action; `shipguard verify` checks the exact diff, evidence receipts, and claims against that object and returns pass/review/blocked with an exact next action.
- Added `taskContractReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: the public receipt proves prepare/verify pass a scoped diff with evidence, block a protected/out-of-scope diff plus unsupported "fully verified" claim, and advance the lowest-value probe to diff-first verification.
- Added `docs/task-contract.md`, direct task-contract tests, package/self-audit coverage, and roadmap updates that center ShipGuard on the proof-gated Codex change loop before broader iOS packs or multi-stack expansion.
- Added `trustHardeningReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: the public receipt fixture now proves composite GitHub Actions do not interpolate raw inputs inside shell bodies, Devspace blocks token-bearing public URLs, unsafe archive extraction is rejected, and release provenance rejects bad or mismatched release URLs. With those receipts green, the lowest-value probe now advances to the persistent proof-gated task contract.
- Added `docs/product-strategy.md` from the 5.5 Pro roadmap critique: ShipGuard's product center is now the proof-gated Codex change loop with a persistent task object, `prepare`/`verify` direction, iOS notification/permission wedge, trust-hardening priority, and a narrower public-command expansion rule.
- Packaged `NEXT_GOAL.md` and added it to validation/self-audit proof so extracted release packages preserve the same value-gauntlet doc surface as the source checkout.
- Added `commandFamilyRuntimeOutputReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public major-family receipt now runs Brand Deck, DockCheck, VibeCheck, WebScan, WebForge, LinkSweep, and ManifestForge against public/synthetic inputs, verifies useful JSON/Markdown artifacts beyond `--help`, and advances the next priority to trust-hardening receipts for GitHub Actions, Devspace, archive/deletion safety, and release provenance.
- Added `proofHandoff` to `shipguard web plan`, `shipguard backend plan`, and `shipguard cli plan`: repaired WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge plans now emit copy-ready evidence packets with validation status, commands to capture, attachment guidance, local-path-safe Markdown, and explicit no-implementation/no-validation-authorization boundaries.
- Added `profileNativeProofHandoffReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public web/backend/CLI receipt now proves repaired plans produce shareable copy-ready proof handoffs, then advances the next priority to command-family runtime-output receipts so ShipGuard keeps moving from help-path coverage toward real output proof for every major family.
- Fixed profile-native first audits so ShipGuard starter files are profile-health evidence only: WebScan, ServiceRadar, and CommandLens now exclude generated starter handoffs from target framework, validation, and risk signals, expose scan-transparency metadata, and require real target source/config/test evidence before reporting proof readiness.
- Replaced the root maintainer instructions and plan template with ShipGuard-native operating guidance so public package users no longer see private app or sample-app instructions at the repository root.
- Added `validationRerunReceipts` to `shipguard web plan`, `shipguard backend plan`, and `shipguard cli plan`: WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge now show the smallest repair plus rerun command for blocked or unchecked validation lanes while keeping target repos read-only.
- Added `profileNativeValidationRerunReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public web/backend/CLI receipt now starts with blocked validation lanes, applies fixture-local smallest repairs, reruns the plans, proves the blockers clear, and advances the next priority to profile-native proof handoff receipts.
- Added `--target <repo>` validation receipts to `shipguard web plan`, `shipguard backend plan`, and `shipguard cli plan`: WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge now classify validation lanes as runnable, blocked, manual, or not checked without executing arbitrary target commands.
- Added `profileNativeValidationReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public web/backend/CLI receipt now proves the profile plan commands emit target-backed validation evidence and advances the next priority to validation rerun receipts.
- Added `shipguard web plan`, `shipguard backend plan`, and `shipguard cli plan` as profile-native fix-plan commands: ShipGuard WebForge, ServiceForge, and CommandForge now convert first-audit reports into scoped tasks, validation commands, stop conditions, ShipGuard-only eval boundaries, shareable output, and report-quality questions without editing target repos.
- Added `profileNativeFixPlanReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public web/backend/CLI receipt now initializes fresh starter targets, runs first audits, converts each through the new plan commands, grades those plans with `ios report-quality`, and advances the next priority to profile-native validation receipts.
- Added `shipguard web audit`, `shipguard backend audit`, and `shipguard cli audit` as profile-native first audits: ShipGuard WebScan, ServiceRadar, and CommandLens now emit JSON/Markdown reports with source signals, validation guidance, next commands, ShipGuard-only eval boundaries, shareable output, report-quality questions, and package/self-audit proof.
- Added `profileNativeFirstAuditReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public web/backend/CLI receipt now initializes fresh starter targets, prepares synthetic source signals, runs each first-audit report, grades the reports with `ios report-quality`, and advances the next priority to profile-native fix-plan receipts.
- Added `multiProfileOnboardingReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public all-starter-profiles receipt now runs `shipguard init` and `shipguard doctor` for iOS, web, backend, and CLI fresh target repos, verifies each target receives `SHIPGUARD_PROFILE.md`, and advances the next priority to profile-native first-audit receipts for non-iOS profiles.
- Added `SHIPGUARD_PROFILE.md` copying to `shipguard init` so every starter profile leaves a profile-specific next-command guide inside the target repo without requiring maintainer context.
- Added `targetOnboardingReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public fresh iOS target receipt now copies `fixtures/demo-ios-repo` into a temporary app repo, runs `shipguard init ios`, starter `doctor`, toolkit `validate`, iOS doctor, iOS inventory, and the first permission-audit plan, then advances the next priority to multi-profile onboarding receipts.
- Added `adoptionReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public fresh-package receipt now builds from a temporary checkout copy, installs the extracted package into a temporary prefix, verifies a fresh Codex plugin cache with `codex status --strict`, runs the first Brand Deck audit from the installed CLI, scores that audit with report-quality, and advances the next priority to target-repo onboarding receipts.
- Added `scenarioRemediationReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public blocked-to-repaired receipt now proves unsafe transcripts, broken docs, stale Codex plugin cache metadata, and incomplete release proof first block with evidence, then recover through the smallest repair step and a successful rerun before the next priority advances to fresh-user adoption receipts.
- Added `scenarioFailureReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public bad-evidence receipt now proves ShipGuard blocks unsafe transcripts, broken docs, stale Codex plugin cache metadata, and incomplete release proof with non-zero exits or blocked reports before the next priority advances to scenario-remediation receipts.
- Added expected non-zero receipt-command support to the value-gauntlet receipt runner so failure-path receipts pass only when ShipGuard rejects bad evidence and still writes the expected machine-readable proof.
- Added `scenarioMatrixReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public full maintainer-loop receipt now runs iOS doctor/inventory/plan/design, report-quality, docs-check, transcript redaction and verification, CI gate and summary, Codex plugin status, and release manifest/index/replay against public fixtures and a synthetic release package before the next priority advances to scenario-failure receipts.
- Added safe receipt fixture preparation to `shipguard value-gauntlet`, including temporary prepared files and deterministic synthetic tarballs under the receipt output directory so release workflows can be tested without mutating `dist/` or private app repos.
- Fixed `shipguard transcript redact` so redaction works when no `--private-term` arguments are supplied on macOS Bash with `set -u`, and added coverage for the default no-private-term privacy path.
- Added `workflowChainReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: a public end-to-end receipt now runs design report -> report-quality -> spec-workflow -> spec report-quality -> next-goal against `fixtures/demo-ios-repo`, proving report-quality questions become SpecForge tasks, validation commands, slash plan/goal text, and a NextRail handoff before the next priority advances to scenario-matrix receipts.
- Added `skillPluginRuntimeReceipts` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: public receipt fixtures now execute iOS ShipGuard design-audit routing, starter UI-polish inventory/plan routing, and plugin cache status proof against public/demo inputs, so skill/plugin usefulness is tested through real ShipGuard commands before the next priority advances to workflow-chain receipts.
- Added `runtimeCommandFamilyCoverage` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: it now executes `--help` for all registered public ShipGuard commands, fixes top-level help routing for command families that previously treated `--help` as an invalid file/path/subcommand, and moves the next priority to skill/plugin runtime receipt fixtures.
- Added `runtimeOutputNegativeFixtures` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: synthetic public bad-output fixtures now prove decorative empty reports and boundaryless design reports are rejected, and the next priority advances to broader command-family runtime execution.
- Added `runtimeOutputProbe` to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: it runs representative ShipGuard commands on public/demo inputs, scores their JSON/Markdown artifacts for machine-readable usefulness, tightens Brand Deck and DockCheck report shape, and retired the old "just run representative commands" next step.
- Added a Lowest-Value Surface Probe to `shipguard value-gauntlet`: after command/skill/plugin/action/doc coverage passes, it ranks deeper evidence signals, upgrades thin starter-skill QA hooks, and escalates all-green static coverage into a runtime-output usefulness probe instead of pretending the ShipYard is finished.
- Added report-quality fixture coverage detection so questions already covered by promoted public fixtures under `fixtures/ios-report-quality` keep their actionability evidence, suppress duplicate fixtureCandidates, render a `Fixture Coverage` section, and move the priority action to the next uncovered question.
- Fixed `release-proof build` so optional proof links like `--issue-url` and `--ci-run-url` are only forwarded when present, matching the documented release command and allowing proof bundles without a tracking issue URL.
- Promoted the ShipGuard Tool Value Gauntlet actionability question into a public `fixtures/ios-report-quality/value-gauntlet-actionability` synthetic fixture so report-quality proves low-value surface concerns can become reusable eval coverage without copying private app evidence.
- Added ShipGuard Tool Value Gauntlet with `shipguard value-gauntlet`, JSON/Markdown output, command/skill/plugin/action/doc/package-proof scoring, report-quality routing, package proof, self-audit coverage, and deterministic eval routing for "test every skill/plugin" product-QA requests.
- Expanded ShipGuard Brand Deck into a toolkit-wide naming system with 57 public command-family surface names, compatibility for `shipguard ios brand`, public-command coverage checks, docs coverage, package proof, self-audit coverage, and routing eval support for funny/vibey/techy naming requests.
- Added ShipGuard ShipYard as the workshop-level product place for the toolkit bundle, with Brand Deck JSON/Markdown proof and docs/plugin guidance while keeping repository and automation paths unchanged.
- Added Brand Deck nitty-gritty call signs for script, scanner, test, action, fixture, JSON, Markdown, log, package, and plugin file families so human-facing output can feel ShipGuard-native without renaming automation-sensitive paths.
- Added Brand Deck actionability questions so `shipguard ios report-quality` can turn read-only `shipguard brand` output into prioritized naming-system improvements instead of the generic "add reportQualityQuestions" fallback; `next-goal` required proof now includes Brand Deck strict proof and `tests/ios_branding_test.sh`.
- Renamed the iOS build/debug/preview/profiler front door to `shipguard ios launchdeck`, with `ios-launchdeck.*` outputs, LaunchDeck receipt rules, LaunchDeck report-quality fixtures, and LaunchDeck routing eval modes replacing the previous generic naming.
- Added report-quality source-finding visibility: source report findings now appear in `sourceFindings`, `sourceIssueVisibility`, and a Markdown `Source Report Findings` section, while report-quality's own `findings` still only represent report-quality defects.
- Promoted LaunchDeck receipt gaps into first-class report-quality fixture work: weak `ios launchdeck` receipt reports now prioritize receipt-specific actionability questions and materialize `ios-launchdeck-receipt-quality-fixture` starter fixtures instead of generic performance/preview candidates.
- Added `shipguard ios launchdeck --receipt <file-or-dir>` so ShipGuard can grade LaunchDeck/XcodeBuildMCP execution receipts after a run, distinguish route plans from proof, and flag missing build/run, UI, preview, log, or profiler evidence for the selected lane.
- Added `shipguard ios launchdeck` as a ShipGuard-native front door for the LaunchDeck surface, emitting repo-aware XcodeBuildMCP build/run, debugger, simulator browser, SwiftUI preview hot reload, and performance-profiler handoffs with proof boundaries, shareable output, report-quality scoring, and package coverage.
- Routed shell-backed `bin/shipguard` subcommands through `bash` from the wrapper so macOS provenance metadata cannot kill helper scripts before their help or validation paths run.
- Expanded `ios spec-workflow` into a fuller ShipGuard-native integration of external workflow inspiration: it now emits `requirements-checklist.md`, `integration-decisions.md`, and `consistency-analysis.md`, records ShipGuard-owned adaptations from Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Xcode Build Optimization Agent Skills, and the OpenAI native iOS preview loop, and keeps those ideas as native proof/report-quality artifacts rather than vendored code.
- Tightened `ios report-quality` so spec-workflow bundles must declare and include the requirements checklist, integration decisions, and consistency analysis, preserve report-quality questions through those artifacts, and fail review when those native integration files are missing or placeholder-only.
- Added `shipguard ios external-audit` so external repos, workflow projects, and post URLs become a ShipGuard-native source audit with capability matrix, replacement ledger, implementation backlog, license boundary, and report-quality questions before any integration claim.
- Added Design Motion Principles as a native external-audit source profile and extended `ios design` with `motionQualityGates` for frequency, purpose, keyboard, Reduce Motion, AI-slop, and performance checks; Expo source matching now avoids false positives such as matching `EAS` inside `easing`.
- Added an `external-source-audit` routing eval fixture so requests to integrate Spec Kit, CodexPro, Expo, Design Motion Principles, X posts, or other external sources must route through read-only external-audit, report-quality, replacement-ledger, and validation-command proof instead of Devspace or generic planning.
- Hardened `bin/shipguard` iOS Python subcommands to run through `${PYTHON:-python3}` instead of direct script execution, avoiding macOS executable-metadata kills while preserving the public CLI.
- Added `ios report-quality --write-fixture-candidates <dir>` so fixtureCandidates can be materialized as public-safe synthetic starter directories with fixture metadata, a minimal report pair, validation notes, and no copied private report paths or app details.
- Added promotion metadata for materialized report-quality fixtures, including `fixture-promotion-manifest.json`, `PROMOTION.md`, suggested repo-relative fixture paths, placeholder copy commands, validation commands, and a private-data review checklist without auto-copying candidates into the repo.
- Taught `ios report-quality` to consume `fixture-promotion-manifest.json` as materialized-fixture metadata instead of grading it as a source report, and to flag unsafe suggested fixture paths, missing copy placeholders, missing validation commands, incomplete review checklists, or stale promotion guides.
- Added a public materialized external-audit fixture and stopped already-materialized synthetic fixture reports from recursively generating another `fixtureCandidates` entry while preserving their actionability questions.
- Added report-quality `fixtureCandidates` so private read-only Ringly/Ilmify observations can be converted into public synthetic fixture recipes with validation commands and private-data policy instead of copying private code or app-specific details.
- Deduplicated repeated report-quality actionability questions while preserving duplicate counts and duplicate source reports, so real-app product-QA output stays prioritized without hiding later unique questions.

## v3.70.1 - Package Codex Status Fallback

- Fixed `shipguard codex status --strict` for clean package/CI environments by resolving the current checkout or extracted package CLI when no installed global `shipguard` command exists.
- Added package-release coverage that runs Codex status without `SHIPGUARD_CLI`, without `~/.local`, and without `shipguard` on `PATH` so release proof catches consumer install assumptions.
- Added diagnostics to the package release test so GitHub Actions reports the exact failing line and command instead of hiding package proof failures.

## v3.70.0 - Plugin Review And Devspace MCP Launch

- Fixed the iOS ShipGuard plugin MCP launcher so installed Codex plugin caches resolve an installed `shipguard` CLI instead of pointing at missing cache-relative source scripts.
- Added Codex status/package checks for stale Devspace MCP sidecar configuration and stale installed CLI versions used by the MCP launcher.
- Added plugin interface website, privacy, and terms URLs and trimmed default prompts to the three Codex actually uses.
- Made release packaging write tarballs atomically so parallel validation cannot leave a partially written `dist/shipguard-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`.
- Added a ShipGuard-native open-source operating surface with support, governance, code of conduct, proposal/bug templates, package proof, and docs routing.
- Added LaunchDeck visual-loop routing guidance so ShipGuard complements simulator browser, SwiftUI preview, and hot reload workflows with receipts, redaction, report quality, and Codex handoff proof.

## v3.69.0 - Performance Validation Gates And Starter Hygiene

- Added `validationRoute` and `stopCondition` to grouped `ios performance` actions so reports show how to prove the first experiment and when to stop before broad refactors; `ios report-quality` now flags grouped performance output that hides validation routes or stop conditions from JSON or Markdown.
- Made copied starter skills product-neutral instead of Ringly-branded, copied the bug-triage prompt helper during `shipguard init`, and taught `doctor`, validation, and package tests to require that generated helper file.

## v3.68.0 - Performance First Experiment Gate

- Added `firstExperiment` to grouped `ios performance` actions so reports name one reversible proof step before broad refactors, and let `ios report-quality` flag grouped performance output that hides the first experiment from JSON or Markdown.
- Hardened release packaging and prefix installation so dirty local `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, `.cache`, `DerivedData`, `dist`, and `.git` artifacts cannot leak into published or installed ShipGuard payloads.
- Fixed iOS ShipGuard skill CLI routing for app checkouts by resolving `SHIPGUARD_CLI` from app-local `./bin/shipguard`, installed `shipguard`, or `$HOME/.local/bin/shipguard` instead of assuming every target app repo contains ShipGuard's source tree.
- Split `ios performance` proof guidance into `localProof` and `manualProof`, render Codex-local versus manual/device proof in Markdown, and let `ios report-quality` flag performance reports that keep proof guidance vague or hidden from Markdown.
- Added high-severity justification for `ios performance` findings so high findings explain the threshold, actor context, or source signal behind severity, render that reason in Markdown, and let `ios report-quality` flag missing JSON or Markdown severity explanations.
- Added grouped performance next actions so `ios performance` summarizes repeated rule clusters before individual findings, caps repeated high rows in Markdown, and lets `ios report-quality` flag repeated performance reports that lack `groupedActionPlan` or a visible `Grouped Next Actions` section.
- Added a performance finding explanation gate so `ios report-quality` flags `ios performance` findings that omit an `impact`/`whyItMatters` explanation or hide that explanation from Markdown, and adjusted performance product-QA questions so completed explanation coverage no longer remains the top next action.
- Added report-quality priority actions so read-only ShipGuard product-QA passes rank the next concrete finding or actionability question instead of leaving developers with an unprioritized checklist.
- Added spec-workflow slash handoff coverage so report-quality flags bundles whose `slashPlan`, `slashGoal`, or `ios-spec-workflow.md` drops the copy-ready `/plan` and `/goal` next-loop handoff.
- Fixed spec-workflow actionability question preservation so repeated report-quality questions are deduplicated before clarifying-question and task caps are applied.

## v3.59.0 - iOS Product QA and Spec Workflow Gates

- Added scoped `shipguard next-goal` output with bounded scope, completion receipt, and following `/goal` handoff support.
- Added iOS `performance-audit` mode and `shipguard ios performance` source scanner for FPS, hitches, profiler fallback, sampled stacks, before/after comparison, ranked SwiftUI/runtime hotspots, physical-device smoothness proof boundaries, and `--shipguard-eval` product-QA runs.
- Added `shipguard ios design` for genre-aware UI/UX coherence, motion, haptics, preview routing, and ChatGPT ImageGen app-icon handoff reports.
- Added `shipguard ios report-quality` to score read-only ShipGuard product-QA reports for eval boundaries, scan scope, proof guidance, Markdown companions, and shareability without grading the target app.
- Added a public report-quality token-shareability fixture and redaction-plan output so Devspace-style connector URLs are blocked from sharing without echoing token values.
- Added `shipguard ios devspace-check` to statically grade Devspace connector readiness, public URL safety, preview evidence, MCP widget metadata, handoff boundaries, and ChatGPT model-choice honesty without grading target apps.
- Added a public Devspace complete-preview fixture and handoff-quality checks for target-resolution, event receipts, raw-coordinate safety, and paste-safe handoff Markdown.
- Added `ios devspace-check --shareable` so connector-readiness reports can omit local absolute paths before report-quality scoring or external sharing.
- Added `ios design --shareable` so design QA reports can omit local absolute app and preview paths before report-quality scoring or external planning.
- Added `ios report-quality --shareable` so the report-quality artifact itself can omit local input/report paths before external sharing.
- Added `ios performance --shareable` so performance/source-hotspot reports can omit local absolute project paths before report-quality scoring or external sharing.
- Added `ios modernize --shareable`, `ios app-intelligence --shareable`, and `ios ai-readiness --shareable` so modernization and system-exposure reports carry an explicit shareability contract before scoring or external sharing.
- Added declared-shareability report-quality findings so shareable scoring flags source reports that are missing shareability metadata or still declare local-mode output.
- Added report-quality actionability aggregation so input `reportQualityQuestions` become a public, shareable checklist for the next ShipGuard rule, fixture, report section, or docs improvement.
- Added `shipguard ios spec-workflow` to turn report-quality actionability questions into ShipGuard-owned constitution, feature spec, implementation plan, tasks, analysis gates, slash plan/goal, and Devspace guardrails inspired by Spec Kit and CodexPro without vendoring external code.
- Added spec-workflow adoption quality findings so report-quality flags shareable spec workflows that were generated without `--from-report` evidence or actionability questions.
- Added spec-workflow artifact completeness findings so report-quality flags declared spec bundles whose generated files are missing, empty, or unsafe.
- Added spec-workflow artifact content findings so report-quality flags placeholder-only or structurally weak generated spec files.
- Added spec-workflow question coverage findings so report-quality flags spec bundles that drop report-quality actionability questions from JSON or Markdown clarifying sections.
- Added spec-workflow task coverage findings so report-quality flags spec bundles whose task plan does not answer the source actionability questions.
- Added spec-workflow acceptance-criteria coverage so Spec Kit-style specs answer report-quality actionability questions in acceptance criteria, not only in clarifying questions or tasks.
- Added spec-workflow validation-command coverage so implementation plans must preserve exact proof commands in JSON and Markdown before adoption passes.
- Added spec-workflow analysis-gate coverage so implementation plans must preserve pre-implementation analysis checks before adoption passes.
- Extended `--shipguard-eval` product-QA boundaries to `ios modernize`, `ios app-intelligence`, and `ios ai-readiness`, with summarized/capped Markdown output where real-app read-only checks showed noisy reports.
- Refined iOS read-only scanners to skip generated/proof/cache directories, disclose scan-scope exclusions in reports, and weight design app-type inference toward app/project source instead of repeated instruction-document tokens.

## v3.38.0 - Docs Link Audit

- Added `shipguard docs-check` for dependency-free local Markdown link audits.
- Added JSON and Markdown docs-check reports plus broken-link failure behavior.
- Extended CI, self-audit, next-goal, source validation, package proof, README, and CLI docs for docs-heavy release guardrails.

## v3.37.0 - Arena Signer Metadata

- Added optional `--signer` and `--signer-url` metadata to `shipguard arena sign` manifests.
- Added `identity_digest` verification so Arena manifests fail when signer metadata is tampered or unsafe.
- Extended Arena signing docs, source tests, package proof, and release docs for signer metadata without claiming private-key identity signing.

## v3.36.0 - Transcript Corpus Demo Proof

- Added a `release-evidence-consumption` redacted transcript fixture with a checked redaction report.
- Extended demo report generation to publish transcript corpus JSON, Markdown, badge, and per-case verification outputs.
- Updated corpus, package, source validation, self-audit, docs, and action tests for the four-case public transcript fixture pack.

- Added verification JSON, Markdown, and badge outputs with blocking behavior for remaining emails, token-like values, secret assignments, local paths, and long hex strings.
- Extended CI, self-audit, next-goal, source validation, and extracted-package proof coverage for transcript verification.

## v3.30.0 - Maintainer Transcript Redaction

- Added `shipguard transcript redact` for redacting maintainer transcripts into public-safe Markdown plus JSON leak-audit reports.
- Added transcript redaction docs, a synthetic redacted transcript example, and focused test coverage for emails, token-like values, secret assignments, local paths, long hex strings, bearer tokens, and custom private terms.
- Extended CI, self-audit, next-goal, source validation, and extracted-package proof coverage for the new transcript command.

## v3.29.0 - Arena Compare GitHub Action

- Added `actions/arena-compare` to run `shipguard arena compare` in GitHub Actions and upload comparison artifacts.
- Added a copyable Arena compare workflow plus action docs for warn/fail benchmark regression checks.
- Extended CI, self-audit, next-goal, source validation, and package proof coverage for the new action.

## v3.28.0 - Arena Regression Compare

- Updated Arena, leaderboard, package, and validation checks for the nine-case benchmark baseline.
- Refreshed public docs and demo expectations with the new aggregate benchmark metrics.

## v3.26.0 - Release Evidence Negative Fixture HTML Report
