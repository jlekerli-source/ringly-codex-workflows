# iOS Codex Workflow Starter

Copy these files into an iOS app repo when you want Codex to work inside explicit product, risk, and validation rules.

## Files

- `AGENTS.md`: root operating instructions for Codex.

## First Commands

```bash
shipguard init ios ../my-ios-app
shipguard doctor ios ../my-ios-app
```

## Adaptation Checklist

1. Replace `[APP_NAME]`, `[XCODE_PROJECT]`, and placeholder command names.
2. List high-risk areas: notifications, alarms, widgets, subscriptions, persistence, app lifecycle, networking, analytics, or release gates.
3. Add the smallest real validation commands your repo supports.
4. Add protected files only when those files genuinely require extra care.
5. Keep the completion checklist strict: no validation, no proof claim.

## Recommended Next Steps

`shipguard init ios` already copies the shared planning template, subagent workflow, scorecard, skills, and bug-triage prompts. After adapting `AGENTS.md`, review:

- `PLANS.md`
- `SUBAGENTS.md`
- `.agents/skills/`
- `SCORECARD.md`
